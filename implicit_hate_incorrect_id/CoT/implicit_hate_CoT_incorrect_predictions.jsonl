Ignoring the image, what does the overlaid text say?\nThe overlaid text reads \"#SJW_true\" at the top and \"Social Justice Warrior\" in the middle with further text under each of the four images that depicts children showing different emotions. The text under the images reads:\n- \"What your friends think you do\"\n- \"What your family thinks you do\"\n- \"What the world thinks you do\"\n- \"What you really do\"\n\nQ1c. If the answer to Part A \"yes\": Are there any derogatory, humiliating, insulting, or disparaging words or phrases used?\nThere are no explicitly derogatory, humiliating, insulting, or disparaging words or phrases used in the text. However, the use of the term \"Social Justice Warrior\" (SJW) can be pejorative, depending on the context it is used in.\n\nQ2a. Ignoring the overlaid text, what does the image depict?\nThe image depicts four different photos of children, each displaying a strong emotional reaction. The expressions range from crying, screaming, to frowning.\n\nQ2b. Are there any derogatory, humiliating, insulting, or disparaging components of the image?\nThe images in themselves do not contain derogatory elements, but the context created by the accompanying text may frame the emotional reactions of the children in a negative light in relation to the concept of a \"Social Justice Warrior.\"\n\nQ2c.

The term \"Social Justice Warrior\" might be indirectly referencing individuals or groups who advocate for social justice concerns, which can include members from marginalized sectors, but it is not a direct symbol.\n\nQ3. Taking into account the previous answers, could the text be describing something about the image that makes it hateful in this context?\nThe text could potentially be framing individuals who are interested in social justice (potentially including marginalized groups) in a mocking or belittling manner through the portrayal of the emotional children, implying overreaction or insincerity. The sentiment behind the term \"Social Justice Warrior\" here could be interpreted as negative.\n\nQ4. Based on the definition of “hate” as hatred, hostility, or violence towards member(s) of a race, ethnicity, nation, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other designated sector of society, should this image be classified as hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nThe image itself, when considered without context, does not promote hatred, hostility, or violence. However, the context given by the text could be seen as dismissive or mocking towards those who consider themselves advocates of social justice, which may be interpreted as hostility towards that group. Whether this qualifies as \"hateful\" would depend on the interpretation of the intent behind the meme and the sensitivity of the individuals who view or are the subject of it. It may not meet the threshold of hate as defined, but it could certainly be seen as disrespectful or ridiculing a particular social stance.", "label": "1", "predicted_label": "0", "phrase_found": "does not promote hatred"}

The hashtag \"LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder\" in combination with the depicted sign could be interpreted as promoting a hostile stance towards a particular political ideology or people with differing views on immigration policy.\n\nQ4. Based on the definition of hate provided, the image might be considered controversial due to the language used in the hashtags, as they appear to disparage a political group and endorse divisive political actions. However, whether it should be classified as \"hateful\" might depend on the broader context and the intent behind the use of such terms. The image itself, as an informational notice, is not intrinsically hateful, but the accompanying text in the hashtag can be seen as promoting hostility towards an ideological group. Therefore, an argument could be made either way depending on the interpretation of the intent behind the message and the norms of the platform it is shared on.", "label": "1", "predicted_label": "0", "phrase_found": "NA"}

This might warrant the image to be considered hateful. However, whether the image should be classified as hateful depends on whether the character is interpreted as representative of the group that the slur targets.
