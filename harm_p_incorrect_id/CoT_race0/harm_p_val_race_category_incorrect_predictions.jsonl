{"img": "images/memes_6551.png", "response": "Q1a. Yes, there is text present in the image.\nQ1b. The overlaid text is a dialogue that reads:\nBiden: I got his email password\nObama: Look you can't use the NSA -\nBiden: I signed him up for Grindr\nObama:\n\nQ1c. There are no derogatory, humiliating, insulting, or disparaging words or phrases used that fit the hate category of racism in the overlaid text.\nQ1d. There are no hateful or offensive components directed at specific groups or individuals based on race identified in the overlaid text.\n\nQ2a. The image depicts two individuals, one who appears to be Joe Biden and the other Barack Obama, smiling and talking to each other.\nQ2b. There are no hateful or offensive components of the image that fit the hate category of racism.\nQ2c. There is no symbolism or imagery in the image used as a reference to any specific groups or individuals in terms of racism.\nQ2d. There are no hateful or offensive components identified in the image directed at specific groups or individuals based on race.\n\nQ3. Considering all previous answers, the text is not describing anything about the image that makes it hateful under the category of racism in this context. The text appears to attempt humor, albeit inappropriately, by insinuating non-consensual sign-up to a dating application, which is not related to racism.\n\nQ4. Based on the definition of \"racism\" as policies, behaviors, rules, etc., that result in continued unfair advantage to some people and unfair or harmful treatment of others based on race, this image should not be classified as racism hate. The content does not mention or imply any racial discrimination or unfair treatment based on race. However, the concept of signing someone up for a dating app without their consent may be considered inappropriate or offensive for other reasons, but it does not fall under the category of racism.", "label": "1", "predicted_label": "0", "phrase_found": "should not be classified as"}
