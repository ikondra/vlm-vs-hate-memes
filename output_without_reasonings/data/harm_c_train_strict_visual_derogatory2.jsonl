The \"derogatory symbols\" seen here are likely intended as playful references rather than targeted derogatory attacks. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. The Corona beer bottle with a mask: This seems to be a pun connecting \"Corona\" (the brand of the beer) with the coronavirus. The mask on the beer bottle humorously anthropomorphizes it, linking it to health safety measures during the pandemic.\n\n2. The image of two individuals wearing masks that look like bras: This is likely a humorous commentary on the scarcity and improvisation of masks during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, where people were using alternative methods to cover their faces when masks were not readily available.\n\n3. The plague doctor mask: It's a historical reference to the beak-like masks worn by doctors during the bubonic plague, filled with aromatic items to protect them from putrid air, which was believed to be the cause of the infection. Here, it might be used to evoke the long history of pandemics and the measures taken by humans to protect themselves from infectious diseases.\n\nOverall, while the imagery uses elements that might initially appear as derogatory, it leans more towards satirical or playful commentary on the reactions and adaptations to the COVID-19 pandemic situation.", "version": "query"}
