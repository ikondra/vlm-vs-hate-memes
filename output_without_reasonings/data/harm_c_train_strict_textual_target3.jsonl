The final line, \"China has begun killing the Karens,\" uses exaggeration for comedic effect and is not based on factual information.

The text and visuals focus on multiple elements:\n\n1. **Making memes about the spread of a disease:** The initial part of the image shows someone's reaction to making memes about a plague in China, followed by a reaction to the spread of the same plague to the US. This suggests a commentary on the nature and effects of global diseases and the public's reaction through humor.\n\n2. **Real-time spread of a serious disease depicted in a map:** The right side of the image features a map showing the spread of a \"deadly coronavirus\" with statistics on cases and deaths in various countries. This part addresses the serious nature of a global health event, contrasting with the lighter tone on the left.\n\n3. **Human reaction through facial expressions:** The images of the person reacting represent shifts in mood and concern, first appearing amused and then concerned, which emphasizes shifting perceptions as the impact becomes more personal or close to home.\n\n4. **Anthropomorphic representation:** The image of a character with a pear-like head and a corporal Ian face represents another layer of humor or surrealism, possibly a satirical comment on how people may react or deal with information and situations absurdly.\n\nOverall, the image juxtaposes various elements—humor, real-world data, human emotion, and surrealistic portrayal—to highlight different perspectives and reactions concerning a global health issue.", "version": "query"}

Additionally, the sentence structure could be made clearer or more formal in its presentation, though the primary grammatical issue is the subject-verb agreement with \"virologists\" and \"wear.\"", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_88.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "Yes, there are multiple possible targets in the text of the image. The image combines a headline about a serious news topic with an overlaid meme that includes a phrase which can be considered as targeting someone for ridicule. The original headline likely aims to inform about a public health issue, while the overlaid meme text may target a person or a situation depicted as foolish or silly. The combination of these two elements creates a complex context with multiple points of focus.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_190.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "The text in the image above seems to attempt humor by co-opting a scene where a character is experiencing distress and ties it to an unrelated and inappropriate situation involving a stereotype about a person sneezing. The text overlay: \"When a Chinese dude sneezes right next to you\" partners with depicted scenes from a movie to create a comparative scenario meant for humour. However, such content could be seen as promoting ethnic stereotyping and could be insensitive, considering it connects a specific ethnic group to a scenario involving illness or discomfort. This could potentially target two groups: the ethnic group mentioned and those who recognize the seriousness of the depicted scene from the movie.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_192.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "The image you've shown seems to be a humorous or satirical piece that uses a photoshopped image of a man, incorporating features resembling those of Joe Exotic, a known public figure from the Netflix series \"Tiger King.\" The text, \"Say hello to the 46th president: Doe Exotic 😲🐯,\" plays on the idea of an unlikely and humorous candidate for presidency. There is only one main target in the humor, revolving around the fictional idea of this exaggerated character becoming president.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_198.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "The text in the image contains racially insensitive language and inappropriate content that is not acceptable. It targets sensitivities around the naming of a virus based on ethnicity or nationality, which is harmful and considered discriminatory. It is important to address and discuss such issues with respect and sensitivity towards all communities and avoid the use of derogatory language.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_202.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "In the image, there are two people that are discernibly targeted by the editing and text superimposed. One person is depicted within a yellow cartoonish figure, representing the main subject of the accompanying text. The second person targeted is in the meme's background, presumably one of the individuals in the crowd, whose real face has been replaced by another face. This sort of image is often used in humorous or satirical contexts, particularly in relation to content from video games or internet memes.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_526.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "The image appears to address multiple targets or issues surrounding the impact of lockdowns. The top text discusses the perceived need for lockdowns to save lives, presumably from COVID-19. The middle part of the image highlights concerns about the negative impacts of the lockdowns, such as potential starvation and related deaths. The use of a fictional character (Thanos from the Marvel Cinematic Universe) at the bottom adds a layer of commentary, suggesting a critique or irony in calling the consequences of lockdowns 'empathy and compassion'. Thus, yes, there are multiple targets or issues discussed in the text, both the advocacy for lockdowns and the criticism of their consequences.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_90.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "The image features a meme with two panels, each potentially targeting different groups humorously. The top panel suggests a method to avoid annoying relatives during the Chinese New Year (CNY), humorously implying the relatives are the target. The bottom panel humorously targets those who might use alarming or controversial social media posts (about returning from Wuhan) to avoid social interactions, indirectly targeting both the person and the social media viewers who might react. Thus, yes, there are more than one target in the text - annoying relatives and social media viewers.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_529.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "In the image, the text includes a quote that says, “It’s for your own good. You’ve got to stop touching your face.” This message appears to be directed at the man shown in the image, who has a protective cone reminiscent of those used for pets, around his head. The presence of the dog looking at the man suggests that the message could humorously be imagined as coming from the dog, to mirror advice often given to dogs wearing similar cones. Thus, in a playful interpretation, there are at least two targets of the message in the conceptual scene—the man and indirectly, the dog, as part of the visual joke.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_95.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "Yes, the text in the image seems to target both the coronavirus and products made in China, using a humorous angle to comment on the duration of the pandemic. The joke appears to draw on the stereotype about the perceived longevity and quality of Chinese goods, making it a multi-target statement.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_96.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "The text in the image attempts to humorously combine two serious health issues: COVID-19, referred to here as \"the China virus,\" and AIDS. It uses a scene from a movie with added captions to create a meme. The meme might be trying to make light of the situation of dealing with two severe diseases simultaneously, using a quote from the movie that implies a confrontational stance between the two illnesses. The humor here targets the notion of an internal \"battle\" between two diseases within a person, although the underlying subjects are both serious health conditions.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_532.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "The text in the image refers to a single target, \"the impostor,\" who is pretending to fix a sabotage that they themselves caused just moments before.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_100.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "The text in the image targets both the character depicted (commonly associated with Sterling Archer from the animated series \"Archer\") and the topic of naming the coronavirus, with a particular reference to its geographical origin. The text suggests renaming the coronavirus as the \"China virus,\" pointing out where it originated, which is a topic of controversy regarding terminology and geographical labeling.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_102.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "The text in the image contains humor aimed at two targets: those who don't have a PlayStation 4 (PS4) and the idea of experiencing a situation akin to playing a horror video game (Biohazard 8, also known as Resident Evil) in real life. The image uses juxtaposition for comedic effect, comparing the lack of a gaming console to a real-life experience resembling a game's content.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_533.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "Yes, the image contains text targeting two separate ideas or actions. The first part, \"Me, trying to do anything on the Internet,\" suggests a relatable experience of being distracted or impeded while using the internet. The second part, \"Are you registered to vote???\" serves as a call to action, emphasizing the importance of registering to vote. Together, they target both a common personal experience and a civic responsibility.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_104.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "Yes, the text in the image seems to target and mention various years (\"1720, 1820, and 1920\") and significant events associated with them (massive plague outbreaks), as well as the year 2020, discussing a \"mysterious\" virus outbreak and referencing reactions to a \"new disease\" starting in China. There are references to past historical patterns of disease outbreaks and concerns about new ones happening, so several different \"targets\" or focal points are presented in the text.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_105.png", "prompt": "Is there more than one target in the text?", "response": "Yes, the image contains two distinct pieces of text that reference two different ideas. The main headline reads, \"As coronavirus cases spike worldwide, China is closing itself off.\" Below this, there is a humorous remark featuring a bald character saying, \"You're about... five years too late,\" which appears to be a separate comment or joke related to the headline, providing a secondary target of social commentary or satire.", "version": "query"}

Here's a breakdown of each panel and its target:\n\n1. The first panel seems to humorously target general social customs or taboos regarding questions one should not ask: a woman’s age, a man’s salary, and the truthfulness of reported data by the Chinese government.\n2. The second panel features a character from the TV show \"The Simpsons,\" Bart Simpson, and jokes about COVID-19 case reporting in the USA and China, suggesting a rivalry or comparison between how each country reports cases of the virus.\n\nThe image uses humor and satire, addressing societal behaviors and international issues regarding the reporting of data.", "version": "query"}
