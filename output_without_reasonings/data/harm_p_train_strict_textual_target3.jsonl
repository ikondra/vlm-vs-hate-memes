The right side labeled \"What I Got\" shows a person at a libertarian event (as indicated by the text) in a much less flattering or conventional manner, humorously contrasting with the expectations set by the first image.

The caption, \"I just saw Joe Biden campaigning at Macy's,\" suggests a tongue-in-cheek comment on the figure's actions resembling public interactions commonly associated with politicians, especially during campaigning. This figure is likely intended to be the target of the joke in the text, reflecting on the political figure's public persona as perceived by the creator of the meme.
