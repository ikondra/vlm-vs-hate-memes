The second part shows two individuals wearing bras as masks, and the third part has a depiction of a plague doctor mask.\n\nEach section uses visual or textual elements to create humor by linking different objects (like the beer or bras) with protective masks commonly associated with the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach uses satire and might be seen as making light of the prevention measures or the name coincidence between \"Corona\" beer and the coronavirus.

{"img": "images/covid_memes_81.png", "prompt": "Who or what is the target of the derogatory words?", "response": "The derogatory words in the image appear to be targeting the coronavirus, referred to as \"Wuhan virus\" in the context of the meme. The meme uses a pun involving the brand name \"Corona,\" which is a type of beer, to humorously suggest using \"Corona\" to combat the virus. The intent seems to be to make light of the situation by playing on the coincidental name similarity between the virus and the beer. However, it's worth noting that making jokes or light of serious health situations can be sensitive or offensive to some individuals.", "version": "query"}

One is running with a mower, and the other one is calling him an \"idiot.\" The overlaid text seems to be critical and targets a person's actions—specifically, a Chinese woman purportedly dodging airport screening. However, the image itself, including the text overlays, is presented in a humorous manner, using the video context unrelatedly to emphasize the sentiment about the woman's actions in a sarcastic or derogatory fashion.

The top text of the meme includes a statement \"When a Chinese dude sneezes right next to you,\" which targets and stereotypes Chinese individuals by connecting them with spreading illness. This is a form of racial stereotyping which is inappropriate and discriminatory. The meme uses this setup to humorously relate the fear from the movie scene to a real-life scenario of someone sneezing nearby, during a time when sensitivity to illness, particularly from viral outbreaks originating in or associated with certain regions, was high.
