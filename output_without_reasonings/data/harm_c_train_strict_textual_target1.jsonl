{"img": "images/covid_memes_48.png", "prompt": "Is there an identifiable target of the text?", "response": "The image you've shared combines a text comment with a picture of a vaccine bottle labeled \"Bovine Rotavirus-Coronavirus Vaccine.\" The comment on the image appears to target media influence and public reaction to health crises by comparing existing veterinary vaccines for coronaviruses in cattle to the human situation. The comment suggests skepticism about media messages concerning the novelty and severity of human coronavirus strains (like COVID-19) and criticizes the promotion of measures such as mask-wearing. \n\nIt's important to understand that coronaviruses referred to in veterinary medicine can differ significantly from those that infect humans and are responsible for illnesses such as COVID-19. The statement and the presentation of the vaccine might mislead by suggesting equivalence between animal and human coronaviruses and their respective vaccines.

{"img": "images/covid_memes_81.png", "prompt": "Is there an identifiable target of the text?", "response": "The image contains a meme that presents a humorous interpretation of the information given about the Wuhan virus, suggesting that it can be killed by alcohol and high temperatures. The image pairs this statement with a fictional quote from Thanos, a character from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, making a play on words with \"Corona\" referring to both a type of beer and the coronavirus.\n\nThe identifiable targets in this image are:\n1. The description of a method reported to kill the Wuhan virus using alcohol and high temperatures.\n2. The humorous juxtaposition using Thanos's image from popular culture to lighten the context of the information.\n\nThe image primarily aims to entertain by linking the serious discussion of virus mitigation with a light-hearted meme.", "version": "query"}

The text, \"When the people of Wuhan are wondering why there's only 1 plane coming to disinfect the city,\" along with \"China Exterminates the Coronavirus in Wuhan (2020),\" appears to play on the theme of large-scale responses to the spread of the virus.

{"img": "images/covid_memes_86.png", "prompt": "Is there an identifiable target of the text?", "response": "The text in the image makes a claim that the Wuhan virus (commonly referred to as the coronavirus) can be killed by alcohol and high temperatures. This claim has been circulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, often as a part of misinformation. While alcohol-based disinfectants and sanitizers can help reduce the spread of the virus on surfaces and hands, consuming alcohol has no effect on the virus once it has entered the body. Likewise, external high temperatures, such as weather temperatures, do not affect the virus once inside the body.

The text implies a sarcastic tone, suggesting that a bandana may not be as effective as the specialized protective gear worn by virologists working in a laboratory environment. The target of the text seems to be the notion or belief that minimal or non-specialized protective gear (like a bandana) could be equivalent in safety to the advanced equipment used in professional virology settings.", "version": "query"}

This versatile and comedic format often extracted from TV shows or movies is generally employed for humorous effect, overlaying unrelated scenarios with comical captions to generate satire or commentary, sometimes creating a sharp, possibly harsh contrast with the underlying subject.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_190.png", "prompt": "Is there an identifiable target of the text?", "response": "The image you provided is a meme that uses scenes from the movie \"Avengers: Infinity War\" featuring the character Spider-Man. The text on the meme, \"When a Chinese dude sneezes right next to you,\" plays on a scene from the movie to make a joke about health concerns that were prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic. The text implies a reaction of fear or concern about getting ill when someone sneezes nearby, which was a common sentiment during the early stages of the pandemic.

The face of the character in the image has been replaced with a photo of a person, making it a meme that may express exasperation humorously at an interruption during critical moments in gaming or other scenarios. The context here is humorous and fictional, emphasizing the frustration in a light-hearted way. There does not appear to be a direct, serious target of the text; it serves more for entertainment and relatability in a gaming context.", "version": "query"}

The bottom panel depicts a man pointing to his temple, suggesting a clever or mischievous thought, with a caption that suggests an inappropriate strategy of lying about being just back from Wuhan to avoid social interactions, referencing the COVID-19 origins.\n\nThe meme is making light of the situation regarding the pandemic and using culturally specific humor related to avoiding family gatherings during Chinese New Year.

{"img": "images/covid_memes_95.png", "prompt": "Is there an identifiable target of the text?", "response": "The text in the image targets products made in China by making a jest about their perceived durability or quality.

The meme format attempts to create humor by combining two serious health conditions (HIV/AIDS and COVID-19) and using a movie scene caption to lightly suggest that the two diseases might negate each other. This approach can be considered offensive as it trivializes serious illnesses. The target of this meme seems to be generating humor through juxtaposition and contrast, but it does so in a manner that could be potentially hurtful or harmful.", "version": "query"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_532.png", "prompt": "Is there an identifiable target of the text?", "response": "The text in the image targets \"the impostor\" as mentioned in the caption.
