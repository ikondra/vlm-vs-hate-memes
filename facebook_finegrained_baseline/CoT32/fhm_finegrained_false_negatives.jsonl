The text does not contain hateful words or phrases targeted at any specific group based on race, ethnicity, nation, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other designated sector of society.\n\nQ1b. There are no hateful words or phrases in this context to explain.\n\nQ2a. The image contains:\n- A photograph of a smiling young woman with blonde hair, wearing a black sleeveless top.\n- Text overlaid at the top reading \"handjobs\".\n- Text overlaid at the bottom stating \"sold seperately\" (note: \"separately\" is misspelled).\n\nQ2b. The individual in the image appears to be posing for a photograph, possibly at a public event or media gathering, with a cheerful expression.\n\nQ2c. There are no hateful visuals in the image. The image itself is neutral, showing only a person smiling.\n\nQ3. The text \"handjobs\" overlaid on a smiling woman's photo with the phrase \"sold seperately\" could imply a crude joke about the woman offering sexual services. This juxtaposition suggests a sexualization of the individual, possibly intended as a form of humor, which can be considered inappropriate or offensive but not inherently hateful towards a specific group.\n\nQ4. There isn't a hidden message in the meme that directly promotes hate towards a designated group as defined in the prompt. However, it does have a sexually suggestive element which could be viewed as demeaning or objectifying the individual shown based on gender.\n\nQ5. While the meme is certainly inappropriate and disrespectful, deeming it outright hateful may require specific context or a target that the content expressly degrades based on their membership to a protected group. The meme is offensive primarily due to its suggestive sexual content, but it doesn't invoke hatred towards the individual based on their race, ethnicity, etc. Hence, it should be scrutinized more for sexual inappropriateness rather than hate speech.", "label": "1", "predicted_label": "0", "phrase_found": "not inherently hateful", "contextual": "1"}
{"img": "img/39867.png", "response": "Q1a. Does the text contain hateful words or phrases?\n- The text does not contain explicitly hateful words, but the phrasing can be interpreted as promoting a negative view towards immigrants, particularly with the use of \"illegal\" which might be perceived as derogatory or dehumanizing.\n\nQ1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\n- \"Stop illegal immigrants\" might imply a hostile attitude towards immigrants, suggesting that they should be stopped or prevented from entering a country, which can foster divisiveness or resentment. \n- \"They’re taking the land we stole\" uses irony to comment on historical theft of land (likely referring to colonization and indigenous land issues in America), which while attempting to be humorous, could offend or belittle the serious nature of such historical events.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\n- A man holding an assault rifle\n- An American flag in the background\n- Text stating \"stop illegal immigrants\" and \"they're taking the land we stole\"\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\n- The image depicts a man, who appears stern and possibly confrontational, holding a rifle with an American flag in the backdrop. This suggests a defensive or aggressive stance towards the topic of immigration mentioned in the text.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- The depiction of a man with a rifle alongside the text about stopping immigrants might imply the use of force or violence against immigrants, which can be seen as promoting hostility or intimidation against a specific group.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The imagery of a man armed with a gun alongside the American flag coupled with the text about stopping immigrants connects the idea of using force or taking extreme measures to control immigration, which ties into nationalistic and protective sentiments.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\n- The hidden message could be interpreted as an endorsement of extreme and possibly violent measures to confront immigration issues, masked under irony and humor. It may also subtly encourage the notion of aggressive or hostile attitudes towards immigrants.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\n- While the meme could be considered as attempting satire or irony, its conjunction of aggressive imagery with sensitive topics like immigration and historical land theft can be viewed as insensitive and potentially incendiary. It might be seen as promoting an us-versus-them mentality and trivializing serious historical and social issues, thus it could be considered as having elements of hatefulness depending on interpretation.", "label": "1", "predicted_label": "0", "phrase_found": "NA", "contextual": "1"}
{"img": "img/47829.png", "response": "Q1a: The text does not contain specific words that are widely recognized as hateful.\n\nQ1b: There are no specific hateful words or phrases to analyze for explicit or implied meanings in the context provided by the question.\n\nQ2a: The components in the image include a photograph of two animals, likely goats, on a rocky hill, and another photograph of a distressed older man covering his mouth with his hand.\n\nQ2b: In the image, at the top, two animals seem to be in a mating posture, and at the bottom, an older man appears to be upset or distressed.\n\nQ2c: There are no explicit or implied hateful visuals based on the description given. The visuals depict natural animal behavior and human emotion.\n\nQ3: The relationship between the image and the overlaid text seems to use the scenario of animals mating to metaphorically represent infidelity, aligning this with the sorrow of the man shown in the lower part of the meme. The text \"ya allah\" perhaps indicates the man's appeal to God in his moment of distress.\n\nQ4: Without further context or explicit symbols and language, there isn't a clear \"hidden message\" that promotes hate. The meme appears to use humor to deal with the theme of cheating, a common subject in jokes, though it might be interpreted as insensitive depending on individual perspectives.\n\nQ5: Based solely on the content provided, this image with its overlaid text should not necessarily be considered hateful as it doesn't directly express or incite hatred or hostility towards any group based on race, gender, religion, or any other identity. It does mix religious expression with a possibly sensitive personal issue, which might be seen as disrespectful or insensitive to some viewers, depending on their cultural or religious background.", "label": "1", "predicted_label": "0", "phrase_found": "NA", "contextual": "0"}
{"img": "img/54920.png", "response": "Q1a. The text does not contain hateful words or phrases according to the standard definition of hate, but it includes sexually suggestive language which can be inappropriate and disrespectful depending on the context.\n\nQ1b. The phrase \"a handjob\" is sexually suggestive rather than hateful. It refers to a sexual act, which in this context might be used to imply an inappropriate and unsolicited sexual suggestion tied to the physical position of the woman in the image.\n\nQ2a. The components and entities in the image include a woman wearing a white t-shirt and black leggings, performing a stretching exercise in a yoga-like pose on a mat inside a gym or studio. The background is simple, focusing on the activity of the woman.\n\nQ2b. The woman in the image is engaged in a stretching exercise, involving a wide leg split and a twisted posture with one arm reaching toward the rear.\n\nQ2c. There are no inherently hateful visuals in the image. The image itself is a straightforward depiction of a person performing a physical exercise.\n\nQ3. The overlaid text relates to the image through a crude juxtaposition. The woman's physical pose, which involves a wide leg spread, is being sexually objectified by the overlaid text, suggesting a lewd interpretation of an otherwise normal fitness activity.\n\nQ4. The hidden message in the meme infers a sexist perspective, implying that the physical pose of the woman is an invitation for a sexual act, which is both inappropriate and disrespectful. This promotes sexist attitudes and objectifies women, though it does not explicitly promote hate against a protected category.\n\nQ5. This image with its overlaid text should be considered inappropriate and offensive rather than strictly hateful. It sexualizes and objectifies the woman based on her activity and posture in a non-sexual context, which is disrespectful. It's an example of inappropriate humor that trivializes consent and promotes sexist views.", "label": "1", "predicted_label": "0", "phrase_found": "not contain hateful", "contextual": "1"}
{"img": "img/93875.png", "response": "Q1a: The text itself does not contain explicit hateful words or phrases.\n\nQ1b: There aren't explicit hateful words used; the implications could be understood differently depending on the context in which the meme is shared. The sentence suggests frustration toward moral and biological teachings by some segments of society but does not specify who or what exactly it is about, reducing the clarity of its intention without additional context.\n\nQ2a: The image components include:\n- A bald man wearing a green t-shirt.\n- The man has one hand covering his face, a common gesture for frustration or embarrassment.\n- There is white text overlaid on the image with the statement about society and lecture on morals and biology.\n\nQ2b: The man appears to be showing a gesture of frustration or despair (as he covers his face with his hand). This could imply disappointment or annoyance.\n\nQ2c: Without specific visual cues that clearly indicate hate, the image itself does not overtly contain hateful visuals. The man's gesture might imply frustration or negativity, but by itself, is not inherently hateful.\n\nQ3: The overlaid text and the image of the man covering his face with his hand work together to emphasize a sense of frustration or exasperation. The image of the gesture complements the text’s message about perceived unwanted lectures on morals and biology, suggesting a feeling of being overwhelmed or bothered by these societal influences.\n\nQ4: As for a hidden message that promotes hate, it’s difficult to directly infer from the text or the image alone without additional context. It might hint at a disagreement with certain societal norms or teachings, but it does not explicitly promote hate against any particular group.\n\nQ5: Based on the content available in the meme alone, it's challenging to label it as outright hateful. The content seems to express frustration or disagreement towards unnamed groups or entities regarding their influence on moral and biological matters. However, it should be noted that if used in specific contexts or supplemented with additional hateful commentary, the perception and interpretation could change, potentially verging into harmful dialogue depending on the audience and manner of usage.", "label": "1", "predicted_label": "0", "phrase_found": "not inherently hateful", "contextual": "1"}
{"img": "img/94180.png", "response": "Q1a. Yes, the text contains hateful words or phrases. The phrase \"let's go beat up lesbians\" explicitly promotes violence against a specific group based on their sexual orientation.\n\nQ1b. The hateful phrase \"let's go beat up lesbians\" explicitly calls for physical violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation, specifically targeting lesbians. It implies hostility and hate towards this group.\n\nQ2a. The image features:\n- A person wearing a floral print dress\n- The person has short hair and is grabbing their head in a distressed or confused manner.\n- The background is a simple, plain red color.\n\nQ2b. In the image, the person appears to be in a state of distress or confusion, grabbing their head while directly facing the camera. \n\nQ2c. There are no explicit hateful visuals in terms of imagery alone; the image does not directly convey a hate message visually without the accompanying text.\n\nQ3. The image is related to the overlaid text in that it uses the shock value of a person dressed in a way that might be perceived as unconventional or mocking, paired with a violent message directed at a specific group celebrated during \"Pride Month\". The juxtaposition of the text celebrating Pride Month and simultaneously promoting violence against a community typically celebrated during this time is meant to be provocative and shocking.\n\nQ4. The hidden message in this meme that promotes hate is an incitement to commit violence against lesbians, which is highly inappropriate and discriminatory. It uses the cover of a typically celebratory and inclusive time (Pride Month) to promote an act of hate and violence.\n\nQ5. Yes, this image with its overlaid text should indeed be considered hateful. It explicitly promotes violence based on sexual orientation and uses a significant and positive time (Pride Month) intended to promote equality and acceptance to instead spread a message of hate and exclusion.
