List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\nThere is no explicitly hateful language in the text. It describes a scenario involving apprehension about having been in close proximity to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, which is not inherently hateful.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\nThe image contains:\n- A blurred depiction of Steve Harvey laughing and another individual with an expression of concern or disappointment.\n- A screenshot implying it is shared on Twitter, indicated by Twitter-specific elements like the profile name, handle, tweet time, and device used.\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\nThe image depicts a dual reaction, perhaps from a television show, where Steve Harvey appears to be laughing heartily while the other person seems perturbed or upset. This contrast suggests a comedic reaction to a potentially serious or nervous situation.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\nThere aren't any explicit hateful visuals in the image. It employs expressions of laughter and concern to convey a reaction that is more humorous or satirical rather than hateful or derogatory.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe image relates to the overlaid text as it uses the facial expressions of the characters to humorously depict Joe Biden's hypothetical reactions upon learning of Donald Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis and recalling their recent interaction. The laughter could imply finding humor in the situation, while the concerned face could represent worry about potential exposure.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\nThe meme does not inherently promote hate. It leverages situational irony and human expressions to create a humorous take on a real-world event. The “hidden message,” if any, might be a commentary on the unexpected and ironic turns of events, particularly in political and public spheres during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nBased on the content, this image with its overlaid text should not be considered hateful. It does not ridicule, incite violence, dehumanize, or demean any group or individuals based on protected characteristics. Instead, it uses humor to reflect on a noteworthy public event without making derogatory statements or promoting negative stereotypes.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "negative stereotype"}

The background looks like an official setting, possibly a government office. There is also text overlaying the image.\n\nQ2b. In the image, the man (Donald Trump) is pointing outwards, as if commanding or telling someone to do something. His expression suggests emphasis and seriousness.\n\nQ2c. There are no explicit hateful visuals in the image. The gesture (pointing finger) and setting suggest authority but do not inherently convey hate without further context.\n\nQ3. The image is of Donald Trump, which visualizes the first part of the overlay text \"Message from Trump.\" His assertive gesture complements the overlay text which makes a directive statement, “LEAVE NOW OR I WILL DEPORT YOU.” This imagines a scenario where Trump directs his typical immigration rhetoric, this time humorously, towards an inanimate entity, the COVID-19 virus.\n\nQ4. The hidden message could imply trivializing the serious issue of deportation and immigration policies by comparing them jokingly to addressing a global pandemic. It might also be seen as making light of the real human impacts of both deportation and the COVID-19 crisis, although primarily intended as humor by juxtaposing political rhetoric with an unexpected, non-human target (the virus).\n\nQ5. While the image with its overlaid text uses a serious and contentious topic (deportation policy) in a humorous context, it doesn't inherently promote hate against a particular group based on race, religion, gender, or disability. It mainly employs satire to comment on the political figure's well-known rhetorical style.

Explain your reasoning.\nThere are no explicitly hateful words in the text.

How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe image likely features well-known public figures who are recognizable and associated with certain political stances or speeches.

Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nThe image and text should not necessarily be considered outright hateful as they do not directly ridicule, mock, dehumanize, or incite violence against a specific group based on protected characteristics.

Reasoning: While the meme criticizes Donald Trump's performance as President, it does not ridicule, mock, dehumanize, or disrespect him or others based on race, religion, gender, or disabilities.

The term \"QAnon\" is linked to a widely discredited conspiracy theory, which is controversial and can be alarming but isn't itself a hateful word or phrase.\n\nQ2a. The components in the image include two characters from the TV show \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\", specifically a man in a dark blue shirt and a woman in an off-white floral top. The man is gesturing with his hands while speaking to the woman.

However, the inclusion of \"QAnon\" and the associated conspiracy narratives could imply promoting or endorsing misinformation or conspiracy theories, which could indirectly foster social division or mistrust.\n\nQ3. The image from the TV show of the man explaining something to a woman is metaphorically related to the overlaid text which depicts different speculative responses to Trump's COVID-19 scenarios. The quote from the character (\"I'm playing both sides, so that I always come out on top.\") emphasizes the manipulation or playing of extremes, similar to the portrayal of the responses as extreme with either \"deep state\" involvement or as a hoax, aligning with the theme of conspiracy from \"QAnon\".\n\nQ4. The hidden message might not directly promote hate but could be considered as spreading misinformation and promoting divisive conspiracy theories which play into fear and mistrust among groups. The meme implies that regardless of the health outcome for Trump with COVID-19, manipulative conspiracy forces (deep state) are at play, hence perpetuating a narrative of deceit and manipulation in political and health spheres.\n\nQ5. The image with its overlaid text should principally be flagged for promoting conspiracy theories rather than outright hate. However, while not explicitly hateful, it indirectly fosters division, mistrust, and could lead to targeting of individuals or groups associated with the so-called \"deep state\" described. This could incite hostility in more sensitive contexts, though it does not meet strict definitions of hate speech targeting specific protected characteristics like race, ethnicity, or religion.

How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The image of the man is used to visually represent the text's message. By stating “IF COVID-19 WAS A PERSON” over the image of this person, it suggests that this individual embodies the characteristics or effects of the COVID-19 virus, linking his identity or actions in a metaphorical sense to something negatively perceived and widely feared.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\n- The hidden message may suggest that the person depicted is harmful or has qualities that are as undesirable and destructive as the COVID-19 virus. This kind of metaphorical comparison can promote hate by vilifying the individual based on perceived actions or characteristics associated with them, fostering hostility and disdain.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful?

What is happening in the image?\nThe image depicts a person, gagged with a red ball, appearing distressed or in discomfort. The setting suggests a confined, possibly private space.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\nThe visual does not directly indicate hate, but uses shock, discomfort, and potentially inappropriate or disturbing imagery (the gag) commonly associated with BDSM to provoke a reaction. This may not be directly hateful, but could be considered offensive or insensitive by some viewers due to its suggestive nature and the appearance of the person.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe image uses an extreme interpretation of \"mask\" as a red ball gag, parodying the idea of masks used for COVID-19 protection. It sarcastically implies that the so-called protection (ball gag) suggested by Trump is absurd and ineffective, which could be seen as a criticism of his policies or statements concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\nThe hidden message in the meme does not promote hate per se towards any particular group, but it criticizes, perhaps harshly, the portrayed figure’s (Trump's) approach or statement about COVID-19, using a parody of protection measures.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nThe image with its overlaid text should not necessarily be considered hateful, as it does not target any specific race, ethnicity, gender, or other protected category with malice. However, it can be seen as disrespectful or mocking toward the former president's approach to COVID-19, which could be perceived as politically charged rather than hateful.

Explain your reasoning.\nThere are no explicit hateful words or phrases in the text, but the implication that the illness of individuals (even if due to their own actions) is a subject of amusement or ridicule could be seen as insensitive or dehumanizing. This can promote a lack of empathy towards those affected by COVID-19, indirectly promoting animosity or trivializing the severity of the pandemic.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\nThe image contains two cinematic characters: the first one (an older male) looks serious and questioning, and the second (a male with face paint resembling a clown) appears amused and is smiling. The overlaid text is divided into two parts, corresponding with each character's portrayed reaction.\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\nIn the image, the first character is posing a serious question regarding the ethical consideration of finding humor in the sickness of protesters against certain public health measures (\"Reopen America\" protesters). The second character finds humor in the situation and states he is tired of pretending otherwise.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\nThere are no explicitly hateful visuals in terms of imagery that promotes violence or discrimination. However, the amused response of the second character (the clown-like figure) to a situation involving illness can imply a lack of empathy or sensitivity, which could be considered disrespectful or mocking towards those suffering.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe image uses stills from a popular film where characters are typically engaged in intense, morally complex dialogues. This specific setup where one character questions the ethics of humor in the context of pandemic sufferers, while the other nonchalantly expresses amusement, directly relates to the text by portraying conflicting viewpoints on a controversial issue. The characters’ expressions underscore the text’s themes of differing moral perspectives.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\nThe hidden message could be promoting a lack of empathy towards individuals based on their political views or actions (like protesting pandemic measures). The meme indirectly suggests that it is acceptable to ridicule or find amusement in the suffering of others if their suffering is viewed as a consequence of their own actions, which can be harmful and divisive.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nThis image with its text should be considered insensitive and potentially promoting harmful stereotypes about a lack of empathy towards groups based on their political or social actions. While it may not explicitly incite violence or hatred against a protected group, it trivializes serious illness and suffering, which could foster a lack of respect or increase division among people with differing views.

Explain your reasoning.\nThe phrase “Be a MAGA Martyr!” in combination with the context of catering to people over 65 suggests an implicit belittling of the seriousness of decisions that could affect the health and life expectancy of older individuals. The term \"martyr\" traditionally refers to someone who dies for their beliefs, and its use here could trivialize the real risks involved.

This can be interpreted as disrespectful and dehumanizing, mocking their significance to society beyond their economic impact.\n\n### Q3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe image of the elderly couple is used to specifically target the demographic mentioned in the text (people over 65). The cheerful demeanor of the couple contrasts sharply with the grim suggestion in the text that they sacrifice their lives for economic benefits, creating a stark and sarcastic commentary.\n\n### Q4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\nThe hidden message in the meme is the trivialization and mockery of the lives of the elderly, suggesting that their death can be a beneficial economic sacrifice. It uses political polarization to frame this message, creating a divisive and disrespectful tone.\n\n### Q5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nYes, this image with its overlaid text should be considered hateful.

There is no explicit ridiculing, mocking, or dehumanizing aspect in the photographic depiction of Kim Jong-un.\n\nQ3. The image of Kim Jong-un paired with a note asking “Do you like me?” might be attempting to trivialize or mock the diplomatic relations or serious political discussions involving Kim Jong-un by reducing them to a simplistic, childish query found typically in school environments about personal likability.\n\nQ4. The hidden message in this meme might be mocking the nature of diplomatic relationships or negotiations as being overly simplistic or petty, akin to children asking about personal likings.

It does not explicitly incite hate or violence, nor does it ridicule, demean, or dehumanize Kim Jong-un based on any racial or personal attributes.

Explain.\nThe image of Donald Trump is accompanied by text discussing his positive test for COVID-19 and implies a change in stance regarding the seriousness of the virus. The relation stems from using an actual statement or implication made by Trump, aligned with the presence of his image to emphasize the point that his attitude towards COVID-19 may not have been serious until he personally contracted the virus.\n\nQ4.

The meme does potentially critique Donald Trump's handling or attitude toward the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting on political or public health commentary rather than promoting hate.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nThe image and text should not be considered hateful. Critique or satire of a public figure, especially related to their public actions or statements, is a typical form of political expression and does not inherently involve hate unless it promotes violence, ridicule, or harm against groups based on protected characteristics.

Kim Jong-un appears to be speaking or gesturing during an event, while the overlaid text adds a context unrelated to the visual content of Kim speaking.\n\nQ2c. There aren't explicitly hateful visuals towards a particular group; however, using the image of Kim Jong-un in a context discussing a pandemic could subtly play into negative stereotypes about Asian responsibility for viruses, a stereotype that has been prevalent during the Covid-19 pandemic. The meme subtly connects Asian imagery with the virus through juxtaposition, which can enforce stereotypical associations.\n\nQ3. The image of Kim Jong-un seems primarily used for visual attention, and to add an element of absurdity, as he is disconnected from the textual subject about Joe Biden. The linkage between visual and text likely aims to mock the seriousness of the pandemic by framing it in a joke format, using a well-known political figure for visual engagement.\n\nQ4. The hidden message in the meme might be trivializing both the pandemic and the character of Joe Biden, reducing significant health and political topics to a joke. Additionally, it might subtly play into racial or national stereotypes by connecting Asian imagery with the virus, even if tangentially and subtly.\n\nQ5. The image with its overlaid text should likely be considered as leaning towards hatefulness, given its trivialization of serious matters like a health crisis and potential incitement of racial stereotypes, along with mocking a political figure in a way that may feed into misinformation or disrespect.

She is wearing what appears to be safety goggles.\n\nQ2b: In the image, the elderly woman seems to be undergoing some sort of futuristic or fictional medical treatment involving intense light, implied by the glow and her protective goggles.\n\nQ2c: There are no explicitly hateful visuals in terms of promoting hate towards any group based on race, religion, gender, etc. However, the suggestion of \"Light and Bleach Infusement Therapy,\" a non-scientific and potentially harmful treatment, may imply recklessness or ignorance towards health advisories and could be seen as mocking those who proposed or believed in such treatments.\n\nQ3: The text \"Light and Bleach Infusement Therapy\" combined with \"Trumping COVID-19 Together\" relates to the image by satirizing the concept of unproven and potentially dangerous treatments for COVID-19, playing on the actual statements made by former President Donald Trump regarding disinfectants and light as treatments. The elderly woman depicted as receiving such a treatment connects the suggested absurdity of the treatment with the visual representation.\n\nQ4: The hidden message could be interpreted as mocking or critical towards the individuals who proposed or supported unscientific COVID-19 treatments, particularly referencing Donald Trump's comments. It promotes a stereotype of recklessness and ignorance associated with such suggestions, using satire to highlight the perceived absurdity.\n\nQ5: While the meme can be considered offensive or insensitive, particularly towards those who might have taken such statements seriously, it does not fit the strict definition of hateful as it does not incite violence or discrimination against a group based on inherent characteristics such as race, religion, or gender.

The text contains the word \"bitch,\" which can be considered a hateful word. It is often used as a derogatory term towards women, thereby making it disrespectful and offensive.\n\nQ1b. The word \"bitch\" is commonly understood as a derogatory term towards women, used to express disdain, anger, or disrespect. It implies that women are subordinate or less valuable, which perpetuates gender discrimination and offensive stereotypes.\n\nQ2a. The image depicts two anthropomorphic characters (one resembling a fireman and another with reddish hair styled in curls) standing in a messy room that features piles of trash, scattered cups, a dirty couch, and random items strewn about. There's a rainbow emanating from one corner of the room as an artistic flourish.\n\nQ2b. The image shows the two characters apparently discussing the state of the room, which is unkempt and in disarray. The fireman looks somewhat disgusted or surprised, while the other character stands with their hand on their hip, nonchalantly.\n\nQ2c. There seem to be no explicit hateful visuals directly targeted towards any individual or group based on race, religion, gender, etc. The visuals mostly depict a sense of neglect or mess without direct implications of hate towards a specific demographic.\n\nQ3. The text \"COVID inside Trump's body\" overlays the visual depiction of a messy room, metaphorically likening the state of President Trump's body or health status, assumed during his bout with COVID, to that of a neglected, disorganized space. The text in the speech bubble, \"Damn, bitch, you live like this?\" implies shock or disgust at this condition. It juxtaposes a health condition metaphorically with living conditions, adding a layer of ridicule aimed at the subject’s health and perhaps his capabilities or sensibilities.\n\nQ4. The hidden message potentially promotes hate by making fun of someone's health condition (Trump's COVID-19 infection), by not only trivializing his illness but also arguably mocking his way of maintaining his personal or professional environments (metaphorically likened to a messy room). Such representations can trivialize serious conditions and encourage insensitivity about personal health struggles.\n\nQ5. This image with its overlaid text could be considered hateful. The meme trivializes the severity of COVID-19, a serious illness, by making it a subject of humor and mockery. Using a derogatory term like \"bitch\" and displaying a general disregard for someone's health condition foster a culture of insensitivity and disrespect, which can be harmful, especially when directed toward public figures or any individual. This trivialization and ridicule could contribute to social stigma about illness, affect public understanding and sensitivity towards those suffering from diseases, and overall diminish the seriousness with which personal health emergencies should be handled.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "can be harmful"}

The content primarily captures a government official speaking during a presumably significant event concerning public health, thus lacking imagery that ridicules, mocks, or dehumanizes any group.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe image relates to the overlaid text by depicting the scene where a national emergency over COVID-19 is being declared, as indicated by the top text.

Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nThis image with its overlaid text should not be considered hateful. The textual content aims to emphasize perceived irresponsibility or contradiction in actions by a public figure post an important health announcement rather than attacking or demeaning any specific group based on race, religion, gender, etc. It does not include elements like ridicule, mockery, dehumanization, or incitement of violence toward any group.", "label": "1", "predicted_label": "0", "phrase_found": "not be considered hateful"}

The photograph of Donald Trump is neutral and does not involve any derogatory or disrespectful symbols or gestures.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe image of Donald Trump, a prominent and often polarizing figure, combined with a message about celebrating as if there is no COVID-19, could be interpreted as minimizing or trivializing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This interpretation arises because Trump's handling of the pandemic was heavily criticized. The pairing of his image with this text may suggest irresponsibility or ridicule of the serious nature of the pandemic.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\nThe meme itself doesn’t straightforwardly promote hate. However, its potential insensitivity towards the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic can be seen as trivializing a crisis that resulted in significant harm and death. This trivialization could be perceived as insensitive and disrespecting to those affected by the virus.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nThe image with its overlaid text should not necessarily be considered hateful as it does not promote violence, hostility, or discrimination against specific groups based on race, religion, gender, etc. However, it does somewhat trivialize the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be seen as insensitive.

List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\n- As the text does not contain any explicitly hateful words or phrases, there are no meanings to list or explain in the context of hate.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\n- The image shows two male characters peering out from the window of a moving vehicle. On the left is actor Jim Carrey, portraying the character Lloyd from the movie \"Dumb and Dumber.\" On the right is an individual dressed as the fictional character Harry, also from the same movie.\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\n- The image captures a scene from the movie \"Dumb and Dumber\" where both characters, portrayed humorously, are riding in a vehicle, likely engaged in one of their misadventures.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- The implicit meaning that could be construed as hateful is the comparison of the character on the right to an unkempt or wild appearance, which in this context is juxtaposed with a reference to a wife. This implicit comparison could be interpreted as derogatory against women by comparing them to wild, disheveled creatures, thus trivializing or mocking their appearance.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The overlaid text implies that the person (wife) being taken to get pampered after quarantine resembles the wild, unkempt character next to Lloyd in the image. The humor is derived from the exaggerated and absurd comparison of one's wife to the comically disheveled character in the scene.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\n- The hidden message, while intended to be humorous, promotes a stereotype by negatively comparing a woman's post-quarantine appearance to a fictional character known for his extreme and silly disheveled look. This reductive comparison can perpetuate derogatory views about women's appearances and trivialize their self-image.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\n- This meme might be considered offensive rather than directly hateful because it plays on stereotypical and negative implications about women's appearances. While not overtly inciting hate or hostility, it trivializes and mocks the idea of a woman needing to be \"pampered\" to recover her pre-quarantine appearance, thus supporting dated and potentially harmful stereotypes. The decision on whether it constitutes hateful content may depend on the interpretation by the viewer and the context in which it is shared.

Explain your reasoning.\nThere are no direct hateful words or phrases; however, there is an implied mocking tone towards those who wear minimal protective gear like a bandana in comparison to specialized virology gear. This could be interpreted as dismissive or belittling of someone's efforts or beliefs in simpler protective measures.\n\nQ2a.

What is happening in the image?\nThe individuals in the image are likely conducting scientific or medical research or testing, using full biohazard protection to prevent virus infection.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\nThere are no explicitly hateful visuals. The use of visuals of highly protective virology gear implicitly mocks or trivializes the use of simpler protective measures like bandanas, but does not directly incite hate.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe image shows advanced protective gear used by virologists, juxtaposed with the text about bandanas. This contrast emphasizes the extreme difference in effectiveness and preparedness between professional-grade and everyday protective measures, which can imply criticism of lesser protection methods.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\nThe hidden message isn't directly promoting hate but more so mocking or belittling the belief that basic protective measures (like bandanas) are sufficient against viruses, compared to professional gear shown in the image. This could be seen as promoting ignorance around appropriate health behaviors or derogating those who adopt minimal protection either out of necessity or misinformation.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nBased on the criterion for hatefulness, this meme does not reach the threshold of promoting hostility directly; it is primarily sarcastic and critical. The meme mocks the effectiveness of bandanas in comparison to professional protective gear but does not attack or demean any group based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, etc. While it trivializes the effectiveness of common protective measures, this alone does not classify it as hateful.

The text in the meme includes the phrase “Nervous Nancy’s unhinged meltdown!” which, while not explicitly containing traditional hate speech, can be seen as pejorative or derogatory due to its mocking tone.\n\nQ1b. The phrase “Nervous Nancy’s unhinged meltdown” implies a demeaning portrayal of someone's mental stability and composure in a stressful situation. It uses “Nervous” and “unhinged” to potentially undermine and ridicule the subject's emotional state, making it seem as if their reaction is irrational or exaggerated.\n\nQ2a. The image components include:\n- Two panels with photos.\n- The left panel features a tweet from Donald J. Trump labeling the scenario as “Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown!”\n- The right panel shows a photo of a woman standing and pointing across a table at several seated individuals in what appears to be a formal meeting setting.\n- Text from Farnoush Amiri referring to a real-life replication of a meme.\n\nQ2b. In the image on the right, it appears that the woman, standing and pointing, is in a heated or intense discussion with other meeting attendees, who are mostly seated and facing her. The context suggests a formal yet confrontational interaction.\n\nQ2c. The implied hateful visual content comes from the contextual setup where the term “unhinged meltdown” is used to describe the woman's actions, framing her assertiveness or participation in a potentially negative light, which could perpetuate gender stereotypes about women being overly emotional or unstable in professional or stressful situations.\n\nQ3. The image relates to the overlaid text as the text describes the scenario shown in the image. The text “Nervous Nancy’s unhinged meltdown!” is likely used to influence the viewer’s perception of the woman's behavior in the image, suggesting that her conduct is not only inappropriate but also a meltdown, rather than a legitimate expression of dissent or leadership.\n\nQ4. The hidden message in this meme could be promoting a stereotype that undermines women's authority and emotional stability, implying that when a woman expresses dissent, it is not a rational or composed act but rather an \"unhinged\" or excessive reaction.\n\nQ5. Considering the demeaning impact of the text and its potential to perpetuate harmful stereotypes about women's emotional stability in professional roles, this image with its overlaid text could be seen as promoting negative stereotypes and hence, could be considered marginally hateful.

In the image, the top section is showing a visual related to medical information or advisories, specifically referencing ibuprofen potentially aggravating coronavirus symptoms. The bottom section depicts a military doctor emotionally stressed or tired, possibly due to the challenges of his role.\n\nQ2c. There are no explicit or implied meanings in the visuals that could be considered hateful. The images serve to contrast the theoretical discussion of medication effects with the practical stress and responsibilities faced by doctors, particularly in a military context.\n\nQ3. The image relates to the overlaid text by contrasting the medical information about ibuprofen's potential impact on coronavirus symptoms (top section) with the real-world stress and challenges faced by military doctors during a health crisis (bottom section). The meme likely aims to highlight the gap between health advisories and the practical challenges faced by healthcare providers in critical situations.\n\nQ4. There does not appear to be a hidden message in the meme that promotes hate. The meme seems to be emphasizing the disconnect or additional stress healthcare workers, particularly military doctors, might face based on changing and sometimes conflicting medical advisories.\n\nQ5.

{"img": "images/covid_memes_5587.png", "response": "Q1a. Does the text contain hateful words or phrases?\n- The text does not contain explicitly hateful words or phrases in the common understanding of hate speech that targets a person or group based on protected characteristics. However, it does use language that could be considered alarmist or fear-mongering about a public health measure (vaccination).\n\nQ1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\n- The explicit meaning of the text is a hypothetical scenario suggesting a negative and extreme physical transformation of Donald Trump after receiving an experimental COVID vaccine. The implied message could be mistrust or fear towards COVID vaccines, viewing them as dangerous or harmful without scientific basis.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\n- The image features a monstrous, heavily disfigured creature that appears burnt or mutilated.\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\n- The image simply shows a grotesque, monstrous creature. There's no action depicted, just the presence of this creature.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- The image itself is not directly hateful but utilizes shock value by depicting a frightening and grotesque creature. The implicit use of such an image in this context might be seen as a tactic to incite fear or distress about vaccination, but it does not directly mock, ridicule, or target any protected group.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The image relates to the text as a visual representation of the exaggerated and false outcome described in the text—that of the former President becoming a monstrous figure following a vaccination. It dramatizes the effect to create a stark, impactful, and potentially misleading message.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\n- While not overtly hateful towards a specific group, the hidden message promotes fear and misinformation about vaccines, which could indirectly result in harm by fostering vaccine hesitancy. This kind of message can contribute to public distrust in health measures, which might be seen as socially irresponsible or harmful.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\n- The image with its text should not necessarily be considered hateful in the traditional sense of inciting hate against a group based on inherent characteristics. However, it is arguably harmful and irresponsible as it spreads misinformation and fear about vaccines, an important public health measure. It is misleading and could contribute negatively to public perceptions of health safety and efficacy, which in a broad sense could be seen as harmful to societal well-being.", "label": "1", "predicted_label": "0", "phrase_found": "not overtly hateful"}

It simply repeats the name of a country.\n\nQ1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\nThere are no explicitly hateful words or phrases in the text used. The word \"China\" is a neutral term referring to the country.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\n- A white T-shirt\n- Text on the T-shirt that reads \"CHINA\" repeated three times\n- A black and white photograph of a man (identity unspecified due to the constraints given)\n- A person (partially shown) wearing the T-shirt\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\nThe image shows a person wearing a T-shirt that has the word \"CHINA\" printed on it three times, with a black and white image of a man between the repetitions of the word.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\nThere are no explicitly hateful visuals in the context provided. However, the repetition of the word \"CHINA\" and the inclusion of a man's image could imply a focus or a statement on China or its leadership, depending on the identity and reputation of the depicted man which might be perceived differently by different viewers.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe overlaid text \"CHINA CHINA CHINA\" is placed directly on the T-shirt, surrounding a central image of a man, which suggests that the text is emphasizing or highlighting the individual within the context of China. It may be trying to convey a message about the man's association with China, possibly in a political or leadership context.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\nWithout additional context, it is challenging to definitively pinpoint a hidden message that promotes hate. The meme could potentially be interpreted as singling out China or its leadership for ridicule or criticism, and if used in a context where such sentiments contribute to prejudice or xenophobia, it might be perceived as promoting a negative stereotype or fostering discrimination. However, this depends heavily on the broader context in which the meme is shared.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nBased on the image alone, it is difficult to categorize the content as outright hateful without knowing the intent behind its creation or use. The text and image do not explicitly ridicule, mock, dehumanize, or incite violence toward any group. However, if this content is used in a context that promotes harmful stereotypes or discriminatory behavior towards China or its people, it might be considered hateful.

Does the text contain hateful words or phrases?\nYes, the text contains hateful phrases that might be considered demeaning or promoting harmful stereotypes towards Chinese people.\n\nQ1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\nThe text implies blaming a whole nation (\"China\") for creating a situation compared to \"biological warfare\" and causing \"mass production in a lab/biolab.\" These phrases promote a harmful stereotype of assigning malicious intent or conspiracy to a specific country and its people. The mention of \"Wake up America... Take your country back\" can be construed as implying a need to defend against a perceived foreign threat, which can further deepen hostility towards Chinese people.\n\nQ2a.

List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\nWhile there are no direct hateful visuals (e.g., derogatory images or symbols), the use of a social media platform to spread messages sows distrust and animosity towards Chinese people based on unverified claims. The platform being used amplifies the potential spread and endorsement of the hateful message.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe image and the overlaid text are directly related as the text is part of the visual representation of the image. The text is the primary focus of the image, attempting to communicate a controversial opinion that labels a pandemic as a targeted strategy, contributing to spreading misinformation and promoting a narrative that can lead to xenophobia.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\nThe hidden message in this meme is suggesting that China deliberately created and unleashed COVID-19 as a form of bio-warfare. This promotes xenophobia and conspiratorial thinking against China and Chinese people, potentially fostering prejudice and discrimination.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nYes, this image with its overlaid text should be considered hateful as it promotes harmful stereotypes and engages in scapegoating of an entire nation and its people, suggesting malicious intent without evidence, and potentially inciting hostility and discrimination against Chinese people.

Each caricature is associated with a speech bubble.\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\n- Each illustrated character is boasting a claim credited to their respective presidencies. George W. Bush says, \"I got Saddam,\" Barack Obama states, \"I got bin Laden,\" and Donald Trump claims, \"I killed more than 150K Americans.\"\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- There is no directly hateful content visually in terms of targeting groups based on protected characteristics. However, the portrayal and claims, particularly Trump's line which suggests responsibility for a vast number of American deaths, could be interpreted as a satirical, political critique, which some might find disrespectful or offensive.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The text in the speech bubbles is crucial for conveying the message or theme of the meme, highlighting perceived or sarcastic accomplishments or failures of each presidency. They integrate closely with the visual depiction of each figure to critique or mock political records.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\n- The meme itself does not promote hate against a group based on protected characteristics. Instead, it uses satire to criticize or highlight different presidential tenures and their impacts or notable actions. The primary target for criticism seems to be political figures rather than entire groups.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\n- This image should not be considered hateful under the definitions targeting race, religion, gender, etc. It does not ridicule, mock, dehumanize, or promote violence/discrimination against such groups. However, it's critical of presidential actions, which can be seen as offensive or disrespectful in a political context but does not qualify as hate speech based on the provided definitions.

IT’S TIME FOR YOUR MEDICINE I HEAR IT KILLS THE VIRUS.”\n\nQ2b. In the image, the depicted manipulation shows Trump seemingly using a household cleaning product in a manner suggesting it's being taken as a medicine, which is unrealistic and sarcastic.\n\nQ2c. The explicit or implied meanings might be mocking or ridiculing the individual (Donald Trump) for his public statements or missteps regarding health advice during his presidency, particularly regarding COVID-19. It implies a lack of competence or ridicule towards his handling of the pandemic.\n\nQ3. The image is directly related to the overlaid text, which suggests that the depicted individual is being advised to take medicine (sarcastically represented by a cleaning product) that supposedly \"kills the virus.\" This ties back to public commentary and controversy surrounding certain statements made by Trump about potential cures or treatments for COVID-19 that were widely criticized and ridiculed.\n\nQ4. The hidden message in the meme could be interpreted as making light of serious health issues (such as COVID-19) and potentially promoting a disregard for accurate and science-based health information. It mocks the notion of misinformed or dangerous health advice.\n\nQ5. Whether the image with its overlaid text should be considered hateful depends on the interpretation of \"hate\" under the specific guidelines provided. It ridicules and mocks Donald Trump based on his actions or statements, which might not strictly fall under hatred against a group but could be seen as promoting a harmful stereotype about competence in leadership. The meme primarily serves to ridicule or mock rather than promote direct hatred or violence.

List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\n- \"Trump Virus\" refers to renaming COVID-19 to associate it directly with Donald Trump. This implies blame for the COVID-19 deaths in America being his sole responsibility. Such a statement can stigmatize and potentially incite resentment or hostility against him, framing him as personally culpable in a global pandemic.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\n- There is a photo of Donald Trump looking serious or possibly upset.\n- Text above states, “Since COVID-19 has killed more people in America than anywhere else in the world, shouldn’t it be called the Trump Virus?”\n- A twitter handle attribution \"@mmpadellan\" at the bottom.\n\nQ2b.

List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- The use of Donald Trump's image with the text infers that he is responsible for the severity of the COVID-19 crisis in the U.S. It could be seen as an attempt to blame and shame him personally, thus potentially inciting strong negative emotions and divisiveness. This could be interpreted as promoting discriminatory behavior towards him based on his role as a political leader.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The overlaid text proposes renaming COVID-19 as the \"Trump Virus,\" directly associating the pandemic’s impact in America with Donald Trump. His image is used to reinforce this connection, suggesting personal accountability, which relates to the text's purpose to prompt questions about responsibility and leadership during the pandemic.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\n- The hidden message, although not overtly violent, could be construed as sowing division and stigma by directly associating Donald Trump with a negative global event, thereby potentially inciting ridicule or hostility against him and polarizing public opinion.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\n- The meme might be considered hateful depending on the interpretation of embedding personal blame for a global crisis on an individual, thus potentially fostering division, stigma, and hostility against Donald Trump.

The word \"scaremongering\" on its own is not hateful but rather describes inducing fear or alarm about a particular issue.\n\nQ1b. \"Scaremongering\" here implies instilling fear or spreading misleading information or exaggerations about the effects of vaccines. The word is not directly hateful toward a specific group but criticizes the action of causing unfounded fear.\n\nQ2a. The components in the image include:\n- Two side-by-side photos labeled \"I FEEL FINE\" and \"2 Months After Getting The Vaccine.\"\n- The first photo shows a person with highly exaggerated and grotesque facial features.\n- The second photo similarly shows a person with an unnatural, zombie-like face.\n- The banner word \"SCAREMONGERING\" across the middle.\n\nQ2b. The image juxtaposes two exaggerated and monstrous facial representations, supposedly before and after getting a vaccine, to sarcastically claim that vaccines have severe, visible side effects.\n\nQ2c. The visuals might imply hateful or harmful content through their erroneous portrayal of vaccine recipients turning into monstrous or zombie-like creatures. This could instill fear or misrepresent the safety of vaccines, aligning with disinformation. However, the visualization itself isn’t directed hatefully towards a specific human group based on inherent characteristics (e.g., race, religion). It criticizes (misleadingly) a medical practice.\n\nQ3. The overlaid text \"I FEEL FINE\" and \"2 Months After Getting The Vaccine,\" combined with the grotesque images, suggests a powerful transformation due to the vaccine, intended to scare or mock. It plays on fears about vaccination side effects, overstating them in an unrealistic manner. The text pairs directly with the images to create a narrative that vaccines cause harm, encapsulating the idea of \"scaremongering.\"\n\nQ4. The hidden message seems to promote fear or skepticism towards vaccines by falsely representing them as causing severe physical deformities, which is not supported by scientific findings. This scaremongering could potentially spread misinformation and discourage vaccine uptake, which may have broader public health implications.\n\nQ5. Yes, this image with its overlaid text should be considered harmful, if not overtly hateful, because it spreads misinformation about the safety of vaccines, potentially leading to fear and mistrust among the public.

The text on the images attempts to create a humorous narrative by linking the two through the theme of bravery and alcohol.\n\n**Q4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?**\nThe hidden message, while likely intended as humorous, indirectly promotes a stereotype that Slavs have a higher alcohol tolerance or consumption rate, which is a simplistic and potentially harmful characterization of a diverse group of people.\n\n**Q5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.**\nWhile not overtly hateful, the image does promote a cultural stereotype that can be considered disrespectful and potentially harmful. It trivializes the complex cultural identities of Slavic people by reducing them to a stereotype about alcohol consumption.

Does the text contain hateful words or phrases?\nThe text as directly written does not contain explicit hateful words or phrases, but it does imply certain contexts that could be interpreted as disrespectful or mocking.\n\nQ1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\nThe text \"Products made in China\" and \"Virus made in China\" juxtaposes man-made products with a naturally occurring virus, which might imply blaming or stigmatizing a whole country or its people for the pandemic. This implication could be seen as promoting harmful stereotypes or discriminatory attitudes towards Chinese people, though it does not use directly hateful language.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\n1. Cartoon character resembling an exaggerated, villain-like portrayal of a typical 'Popeye' figure labeled \"Products made in China.\"\n2. Cartoon character resembling an exaggerated, muscular version of Mickey Mouse labeled \"Virus made in China.\"\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\nThe image is showing two caricatures: one weak and seemingly defeated, and the other strong and menacing. The first character, associated with \"Products made in China,\" looks broken down, which contrasts with the strong, menacing character associated with \"Virus made in China.\"\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\nThe implied meanings of these visuals may be that products from China are inferior or harmful, similar to a virus, which is a negative and harmful representation. It uses stereotypes and visual exaggeration to convey these ideas, which could be seen as ridiculing or mocking.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe image visually represents the text by showing a defeated character for \"Products made in China\" implying inferiority, and a strong, menacing character for “Virus made in China” implying destructiveness and fear. This association visually supports the text's intention to mock and stereotype, further enhancing the message that both products and the virus from China are problematic.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\nThe hidden message in this meme is the comparison and grouping of all things originating from China (both products and a virus) as undesirable or harmful. This underpins a stereotype that Chinese-manufactured goods and biological occurrences from China (like the virus) are both to be viewed negatively, which promotes xenophobia.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nThis image with its overlaid text should be considered hateful because it implicitly promotes harmful stereotypes about a country and its products, equating them with a deadly virus. This kind of messaging can incite or amplify xenophobia and discriminates against an entire nation and its people based on the origin of a global pandemic and cultural goods.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "should be considered hateful"}

Does the text contain hateful words or phrases?\n- The text does not contain explicitly hateful words or phrases, but the implied message can be considered harmful or insensitive.\n\nQ1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\n- The implied meaning of the phrase \"Can't die of COVID if you kill yourself\" trivializes the serious issues surrounding both the COVID-19 pandemic and suicide. It makes a mocking suggestion that suicide could be a way to avoid dying from COVID-19, which is disrespectful and harmful to individuals affected by either.\n\nQ2a.

List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- The visual of the political figure holding a cleaning product while questioning if it is a vaccine could be seen as ridiculing the individual based on past public statements or controversies. It may imply irresponsibility or ignorance, which could be considered disrespectful.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The overlaid text \"Is this a vaccine?\" in connection with the image of a cleaning product being presented as a potential vaccine mocks the seriousness of the search for COVID-19 vaccines. It satirically criticizes or ridicules the individual's ability to appropriately address the pandemic.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\n- The hidden message may not necessarily promote outright hate, but it trivializes serious public health issues (COVID-19 and vaccine development) and mental health issues (suicide). It uses these crises as elements of ridicule, which may foster insensitivity and detachment from the gravity of these subjects.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\n- While the meme does not directly invoke hate towards specific groups, it can be considered insensitive and inappropriate as it trivializes serious health matters and promotes a harmful narrative about suicide. Such content could contribute to stigma or emotional distress among those directly affected by the mentioned topics. As such, it's arguably more harmful than directly hateful, promoting a lack of seriousness towards critical and life-threatening issues.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "can be considered insensitive"}

List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\n- \"China did all of this.\" This phrase implies that the nation of China or its people as a whole are responsible for the negative outcomes related to the coronavirus as mentioned in the preceding text.

List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- There is no direct hateful imagery in the picture of the doctor; the potential for hate arises primarily from how the text could be interpreted as blaming the entire nation of China for the pandemic, thus potentially promoting stigma against people associated with that nationality.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The image of the Chinese doctor seems to be used to underline the severity and credibility of the claims made in the tweet. It visually supports the text which praises the doctor for his bravery while criticizing the broader response by Chinese entities.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\n- The hidden message seems to be an indiscriminate blame towards China and its people for the pandemic, which simplifies complex sociopolitical and health issues into a narrative that could promote xenophobia and racial prejudice against individuals of Chinese descent.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\n- Considering the broad and undiscriminating blame placed on China by the phrase \"China did all of this,\" which can reinforce harmful stereotypes and generalize guilt, the meme should be considered potentially hateful.

They are looking towards the viewer with a facial expression that can be interpreted as humorous or mocking.\n\n**Q2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.**\nThe visual of the foil hat, often tied to conspiracy theories and paranoia, implicitly mocks those who are gullible or delusional enough to believe in such ideas. It might imply that the person depicted (and by extension, the group they are parodying) believes in baseless or irrational theories, thus demeaning their intelligence or sanity.\n\n**Q3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.**\nThe image of the person with the foil hat complements the text's mocking tone towards individuals skeptical of mainstream medical advice (in this case, vaccinations).

What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?**\nThe hidden message in this meme could be promoting the idea that those who are skeptical or cautious about vaccination are ridiculous, irrational, or mentally unstable. This can incite further division and ridicule towards individuals based on their health choices or beliefs.\n\n**Q5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.**\nGiven that the image and text together mock and stereotype a group based on their health decisions, promoting a stereotype of them as irrational or 'crazy,' it can be considered hateful.

Explain your reasoning.\n- The text seems to trivialize the emotion of jealousy by comparing it to a serious, life-threatening virus (COVID-19). The sarcastic tone implied by \"Get well soon sweeties xoxo\" could be seen as mocking or belittling to those it addresses.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\n- There are two images combined in the meme. The left side shows a close-up of part of a person's body from the back, focusing on their buttocks, with papers and what appears to be a mobile phone half-inserted into their back pocket. The right image shows a man (Donald Trump) at a lectern, speaking or preparing to speak.\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\n- The left image captures a perhaps unintentionally humorous or embarrassing moment where someone has papers and a phone awkwardly sticking out of their pocket. In the right image, Trump is either speaking or preparing to speak in a formal setting, possibly related to political or public matters.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- There's a potential implication that the juxtaposition of these images ridicules or mocks the person featured in the left image, possibly suggesting incompetence or sloppiness. The combination with Trump’s image could imply a contrast meant to demean.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The text mentioning jealousy may implicitly connect with the images, suggesting that those ridiculed or mocked in the meme could be 'jealous' of Trump’s position or speaking capability. It creates a context where the left image is used to belittle, contrasting with Trump's portrayed professionalism or authority in the right image.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\n- The hidden message might rest on using an image of someone in an embarrassing pose juxtaposed with a figure (Donald Trump) known for his powerful or authoritative public appearances to mock or demean the person in the embarrassment. It subtly conveys disrespect and mockery which can foster an environment of hate or antagonism.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\n- It could be considered hateful as it seems to employ mockery and perhaps trivializes serious matters (comparing a global health crisis to feelings of envy).

Considering the guidelines for determining hate in a meme, this image and text combination should be considered hateful.

While the terms themselves are not hateful:\n- The term \"Trump supporters\" could imply a generalized view about a group of people based on their political affiliation but does not inherently express hatred or violence.\n- \"There is no virus\" can be seen as mocking those who disagree with scientific consensus on COVID-19, potentially trivializing public health efforts. This could indirectly be considered disrespectful but does not directly promote hate.\n- \"Pray for Trump\" is a neutral statement generally indicating support or concern, and does not inherently carry hateful connotations.\n\nQ2a.

It plays on the perceived dilemma faced by this group, suggesting incongruity in their beliefs or priorities.\n\nQ4. The hidden message or implicit meaning of the meme seems to imply that Trump supporters are faced with contradictory impulses or illogical choices, reinforcing stereotypes of irrationality or ignorance among this group. It showcases this through the absurdity of the options on the buttons.\n\nQ5. While the image with its overlaid text can be considered offensive to some, especially those who are supporters of Trump or those who may feel this portrays them unfairly, it may be seen as satirical rather than outright hateful. The content primarily ridicules and mocks but does not explicitly promote hostility, dehumanization, or violence towards Trump supporters. However, it does trivialize and stereotype, which can contribute to a dismissive or belittling attitude towards this group.

The image relates to the overlaid text by comparing two groups metaphorically associated with societal behavior or attitudes through the animals depicted:\n- \"YOUR FRIENDS\" associated with the masked sheep, implying conformity or passive behavior.\n- \"MY FRIENDS\" associated with the unmasked lions, implying boldness or defiance.\nThis suggests a contrast in behaviors or characteristics attributed to different groups of friends, using visuals and text to imply a dichotomy.\n\nQ4. The hidden message in the meme, which could be promoting a form of hate, may imply a derogatory or dismissive attitude towards those who comply with health guidelines (e.g., wearing masks), likening them to sheep, a common metaphor for docility and lack of individual thought. Conversely, it glorifies those who do not follow such measures, associating them with the strength and independence of lions.\n\nQ5. Whether this image with its overlaid text should be considered hateful depends on the interpretation of its metaphorical comparison. It promotes a divisive stereotype, criticizing one group for compliance (potentially aligning with public health measures during a pandemic) and elevating another for noncompliance. Given the potential to foster resentment or ridicule towards those who follow public health advice, it might be seen as promoting discriminatory attitudes, thus aligning with a form of subtle hate speech.

List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases.

This phrase can imply a negative stereotype or stigmatization associated with the city and by extension, potentially towards its inhabitants or people of the associated nationality. This implication could be considered disrespectful or discriminatory if it's seen as making a derogatory reference to the city in the context of a global health crisis.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\n- The image shows a table with people playing cards.\n- The table is strewn with playing cards and hands of cards are visible.\n- There are numerous protective face masks spread across the table and held by players.\n\nQ2b.

List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- The visual of masks incorporated into a poker game could imply that the act of wearing masks (associated largely with the pandemic beginning in Wuhan) is now a part of casual or recreational activities, which could trivialize or mock the seriousness of pandemic safety measures. However, there is no directly hateful visual imagery; this interpretation highly depends on the context.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The overlaid text “Poker Night Wuhan Style” combined with the visual of a poker game using masks suggests a theme night inspired by or referencing the pandemic protocols that started in Wuhan. It links the concept of a leisure activity with a serious global health issue originating from Wuhan, which may be seen as making light of or trivializing the circumstances surrounding the city during the pandemic.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\n- The hidden message may not be overtly hateful, but it potentially trivializes and mocks the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in Wuhan. By associating \"Wuhan Style\" with a game night using masks, it could subtly perpetuate negative stereotypes or stigmatization of the city and indirectly, its residents or people of the region. This could foster insensitive attitudes or discrimination.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\n- While not overtly hateful, the meme may be considered insensitive and could contribute to stereotyping or negative bias against Wuhan and potentially Chinese people by making light of a severe global health crisis. The term \"Wuhan Style\" in this context could be seen as trivializing the serious impacts of the pandemic, which affected millions worldwide, thereby contributing to disrespectful or discriminatory attitudes.

This kind of mocking can propagate disrespect towards individuals based on physical characteristics, even though it’s presented in a humorous context.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful?

List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases.

List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- While there are no explicitly hateful visuals such as symbols or actions directly promoting hate, the use of the Barbie doll images morphed to show weight gain and the accompanying text indirectly mocks and trivializes the struggle with weight gain. The transformation shown and wording used could imply that gaining weight is undesirable and humorous, which can be hurtful.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The images are directly related to the overlaid text, illustrating the narrative of personal weight gain during quarantine. Each component supports the central theme of anxiety and humor about increased body weight under the conditions of lockdown or restricted movement.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\n- The hidden message, though likely intended as humor, promotes a negative stereotype that gaining weight is inherently bad or laughable. It also subtly mocks individuals who might require medical intervention due to obesity, possibly leading to shame and stigma about body weight issues.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful?

Bear Grylls' image is often used in memes to exaggerate a survivalist or over-the-top reaction to everyday situations, which in this context, is used to mock the idea of blaming an entire nation or ethnicity.\n\nQ4: The hidden message in this meme appears to trivialize and mock the serious issue of a global pandemic by attributing it humorously to Chinese eating habits, which indirectly promotes racial stereotyping and scapegoating of a specific ethnic group. This could contribute to xenophobia or racism.\n\nQ5: Yes, this image with its overlaid text should be considered hateful as it uses racial stereotyping and wrongful blaming of an ethnic group for a global health crisis. This promotes a discriminatory viewpoint and diminishes the seriousness of the issue, contributing adversely to the discrimination against Chinese people or people perceived as Chinese.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "could be considered hateful"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_1844.png", "response": "Based on the provided information and the image, I will provide a detailed answer for each question:\n\n**Q1a. Does the text contain hateful words or phrases?**\nNo, the text itself does not contain explicitly hateful words or phrases.\n\n**Q1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.**\nAs there are no hateful words or phrases explicitly presented in the text, there is no direct or implied meaning that explicitly promotes hate. However, the context of linking a virus joke to a specific ethnic cuisine might imply negative stereotypes or xenophobic sentiments, which can be considered offensive or insensitive.\n\n**Q2a. List all components and entities in the image.**\nThe image consists of two panels:\n1. The left panel shows a woman pointing a finger, appearing to speak or react to something.\n2. The right panel displays a bowl of soup with an overlaid text stating a URL (https://pho.king).\n\n**Q2b. What is happening in the image?**\nIn the left panel, the woman seems to be reacting or speaking intensively, possibly critical or displeased. In the right panel, a bowl of soup is shown which is likely meant to represent a dish from Vietnamese cuisine (phở).\n\n**Q2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.**\nNo explicit hateful visuals are depicted. However, implicitly, the combination of the panels along with the text could be construed as mocking or ridiculing a cultural dish by tying it humorously to a virus, potentially fostering negative stereotypes or xenophobic attitudes towards the Vietnamese or Asian cultures generally.\n\n**Q3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.**\nThe image relates to the overlaid text by juxtaposing two seemingly unrelated elements (a reaction and a Vietnamese soup) to create a pun based on the pronunciation of \"pho\" (a key ingredient in the soup) sounding like \"faux,\" which plays into the URL joke. It could be interpreted that the reaction in the first panel is towards the joke made in the second panel.\n\n**Q4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?**\nThe hidden message, while not overtly promoting hate, uses cultural food (phở) in a pun that might subtly imply insensitivity or trivialization concerning health concerns (the referenced \"virus joke\"). It can propagate insensitive humor that trivializes serious issues or contributes to stereotypes about a culture or ethnicity.\n\n**Q5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.**\nConsidering the sensitivity of content that merges ethnicity with stereotypes or health concerns (especially of viral nature), this image may not explicitly be hateful but is certainly insensitive and could be offensive to individuals from the referenced culture. It can perpetuate negative stereotypes or xenophobic views, therefore, it could be considered inappropriate or offensive, though not hatefully aggressive.\n", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "can be considered offensive"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_1871.png", "response": "Q1a. Does the text contain hateful words or phrases?\n- The text itself does not contain explicitly hateful words or phrases like slurs or explicitly offensive language. However, it uses the phrase \"Non-Essential Worker\" which could potentially be viewed as derogatory depending on the context and interpretation.\n\nQ1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\n- The term \"Non-Essential Worker\" might be perceived as belittling to those whose jobs were classified as non-essential during pandemic lockdowns, suggesting their work is less valuable or important, which could foster resentment or undervaluation of these professions.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\n- A Barbie doll in casual attire, labeled \"Quarantine Edition\" and \"Non-Essential Worker\"\n- The doll has accessories that include wine and a bowl of snacks.\n- The setting appears to be a store shelf with various other dolls in the background.\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\n- The image shows a hand holding a boxed Barbie doll which is characterized as a \"Quarantine Edition: Non-Essential Worker.\" This suggests a product designed to represent or satirize a type of worker during the quarantine period.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- While not overtly hateful, the image might imply a trivialization or mockery of those whose work was deemed non-essential during COVID-19 lockdowns. This can demean the experience of people who faced financial and emotional hardships due to being out of work or marginalized during this period.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The overlaid text \"Finally a realistic Barbie\" links the image of the Barbie doll with the concept of it being more relatable or true-to-life because it represents individuals not typically glorified, in this case, a non-essential worker during quarantine. It suggests realism through the portrayal of contemporary, relatable scenarios.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\n- The hidden message might be an undermining or belittling of individuals whose jobs were classified as non-essential during the pandemic, implying that their contributions or roles are trivial or less significant, promoting a negative stereotype about categories of professions.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\n- While the image and text could be considered insensitive or potentially hurtful by trivializing the societal roles and challenges of those labeled as \"non-essential\" workers, it does not seem to meet the threshold for hate under the strict definition, which involves direct hostility, violence, or severe discrimination against specific groups. However, it could be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes, so it might be considered borderline or tactless rather than hatefully intended.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "negative stereotype"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_1928.png", "response": "Q1a. Does the text contain hateful words or phrases?\nNo, the text does not contain explicitly hateful words or phrases.\n\nQ1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\nSince there are no explicitly hateful words or phrases used, there are no meanings to list.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\nThe image displays a blurred background with a few people and a focus on a small, green, rectangular snooker or pool table.\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\nIn the image, there appears to be a game of snooker or pool taking place on a small table, likely depicting a casual or recreational setting.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\nThere are no explicitly hateful visuals in the image. The setting involves a game of snooker or pool, which is neutral and does not imply hate.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe image relates to the text primarily through the metaphor of a game. The text mentions \"steady batting\" and \"bowl her out,\" which are terms used in cricket, suggesting that the speaker is playing a long, strategic game. The image, however, shows a snooker or pool game, possibly implying strategy and skill in a domestic setting, alluding to handling a situation with his wife who is bored.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\nThe meme does not explicitly promote hate; however, the implication that the speaker can \"bowl her out\" in terms of dealing with his wife being bored might suggest trivializing or mocking the wife's feelings or thoughts. This can be perceived as disrespectful or patronizing, though not overtly hateful.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nThis image with its overlaid text should not necessarily be considered hateful as it does not incite violence, degrade, or dehumanize anyone based on race, religion, gender, or any other protected category. It more subtly hits at traditional gender roles or a trivialization of a spouse's feelings, which could be considered offensive by some but doesn’t rise to the level of hate as defined prior.

List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\n- The text does not contain any hateful words or phrases. However, the implication of the situation described (informing someone they have a serious illness as a part of a photographic project) can be considered insensitive or unethical, but not directly hateful.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\n- The image is split into two panels:\n  1. The left panel shows a woman with a solemn expression.\n  2. The right panel shows another woman who is smiling, positioned in front of the pyramids.\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\n- The left panel seems to show a woman’s reaction, supposedly after being told she has Coronavirus. The right panel shows a woman before receiving such news, in a happy and tourist-like pose.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- While there are no explicitly hateful visuals, the implied use of a serious health diagnosis as a tool to elicit emotional responses for a photograph could be seen as ethically questionable. This misuse of medical information for artistic or shock value trivializes the impact and severity of the disease, which could be interpreted as insensitive, especially to those affected by such illnesses.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The text describes a photographic project where individuals are captured before and after being told they have Coronavirus. The images correspond to this description, showing two different emotional states of the subjects that align with the sequence described in the text.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\n- The meme itself does not promote traditional forms of hate against groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, etc. However, it trivializes a significant health issue, potentially generating fear or anxiety about illness as a tool for entertainment. This indirect insensitivity can perpetuate stigmas around diseases, which may lead to dismissive or negligent attitudes towards those affected.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\n- Whether this is considered hateful may not align strictly with definitions focusing on race, ethnicity, or gender discrimination. However, the image and text should be seen as highly inappropriate and insensitive. The meme trivializes a serious health issue and uses it for shock value or humor, which could lead to psychological distress or minimize the severity of the condition.

Does the text contain hateful words or phrases?\nNo, the visible text in the image does not contain explicitly hateful words or phrases.\n\nQ1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\nThere are no explicitly hateful words or phrases. However, the implication of wishing harm to those \"coming from Corona Virus\" could be seen as promoting harmful stereotypes or discriminatory behaviors towards specific groups, potentially tying individuals from certain locations or backgrounds to the coronavirus in a detrimental way.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\nThe image is split into two panels:\n- Left Panel: A dark, dramatic depiction of what appears to be soldiers in historical battle armor fighting.\n- Right Panel: A photograph of a man (Paul Gosar) wearing a suit, standing at a podium and smiling at a crowd. In the background, a banner reads “TRUMP”.\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\nIn the left panel, soldiers are engaged in a battle, which suggests violence or conflict.\nIn the right panel, a political figure is addressing or engaging with an audience at what seems to be a public or campaign event.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any hateful visuals. Explain your reasoning.\nThe visuals themselves are not directly hateful; however, the context of a politician explicitly excluding a group of people based on a virus origin (implied through the text) could be interpreted as promoting exclusion or intolerance towards certain groups of people, especially if tied to geographic or ethnic origins.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe left image shows a dramatic battle scene, paired with text about preferring to die gloriously in battle than from a virus, suggesting a glorification of historical or heroic violence over dying from a disease, which trivializes the impact and seriousness of a global pandemic.\nThe right image shows a politician, with text excluding those \"coming from Corona Virus,\" which can imply a prejudice or discriminatory stance against people perceived to be associated with the virus, whether by location or ethnicity.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes hate?\nThe meme suggests a disregard and lack of empathy for people suffering or perceived to be connected with the coronavirus, potentially fueling stigma and discrimination against specific groups, particularly those associated with where the virus was initially prominent.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nGiven the context and implications, yes, this image can be considered hateful. It appears to trivialize the severity and human impact of the coronavirus pandemic and promotes discriminatory attitudes towards people associated with the virus, whether directly or through implied geographical or ethnic links.
