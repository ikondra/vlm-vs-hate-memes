{"img": "img/01796.png", "response": "Q1a. Does the text contain racist words or phrases?\nYes, the phrase \"how to get stoned with no weed\" can be interpreted as racist.\n\nQ1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any racist words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\nThe phrase \"how to get stoned with no weed\" implies a pun involving the violent act of stoning, which is a form of capital punishment still used in some parts of the world, often in association with Islamic law. This can stereotype and vilify Muslims by linking the practice of stoning (a severe and controversial punishment) indiscriminately with Muslim people, unfairly representing their beliefs and customs.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\n- Two women wearing hijabs hugging and smiling.\n- Background of a grey brick wall.\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\nThe image shows two women, both wearing hijabs, embracing affectionately. One woman is kissing the other on the cheek, and both appear to be happy and smiling.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any racist visuals. Explain your reasoning.\nThe visuals themselves (two women wearing hijabs and smiling) are not racist; they depict a positive interaction. However, when paired with the text, the visual representation of Muslim women can become a tool to reinforce the meme's pun on the violent act of stoning, contributing to a potentially racist interpretation.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\nThe text makes a pun that plays on the double meaning of \"stoned,\" referring both to the act of using cannabis (\"weed\") to get high and the act of stoning as a form of punishment. The image features women wearing hijabs, which identifies them as likely Muslims, thus linking the text's reference to stoning to the Islamic practice, albeit in a misleading and pejorative manner.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes racism?\nThe hidden message plays into xenophobic and Islamophobic stereotypes by using a word pun to connect Muslim women to a harsh penal practice (stoning), thus promoting a negative and hurtful view of a whole group based on religion and possibly ethnicity.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered racism hate? Explain your reasoning.\nYes, this image with its overlaid text should be considered as promoting racist hate. While the image alone is not hateful, the combination with the text uses a cultural reference to stoning to make a harmful joke about a serious issue, targeting a religious group. This perpetuates stereotypes and can foster misunderstanding and hostility towards Muslims, thus meeting the criteria for racist content.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "promotes racism"}
{"img": "img/31752.png", "response": "Q1a. Does the text contain racist words or phrases?\n- No, the text does not contain racist words or phrases.\n\nQ1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any racist words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\n- There are no racist words or phrases in the text to analyze for explicit or implied meanings.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\n- The image features a stylized \"thumbs up\" symbol colored with the colors of the rainbow flag, commonly associated with LGBTQ+ pride.\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\n- The image shows a rainbow-colored thumbs up symbol against a pink background.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any racist visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- There are no explicitly racist visuals within the image. The rainbow-colored thumbs up is related to LGBTQ+ themes rather than racial or ethnic representations.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The relation between the image and the text appears to satirize or criticize the idea of selecting or adopting identities (implied by the colorful, usually LGBTQ+ associated, thumbs up) especially in the context of mental illness. The meme seems to be making a statement on the perception that individuals can choose certain traits or identities, which in this case controversially includes mental illness.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes racism?\n- The meme does not specifically promote racism; rather, it might potentially be interpreted as offensive or insensitive towards mental health issues and the LGBTQ+ community by equating mental illness with a choice and using the rainbow as a symbol which might suggest commentary on gender identity being a choice, which is a contentious and sensitive topic.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered racism hate? Explain your reasoning.\n- The image and text should not be considered racist since it does not target or discriminate against any racial or ethnic groups. However, it could be viewed as offensive or insensitive toward mental health and LGBTQ+ issues, which are separate from racial discrimination. The meme seems to misrepresent mental illness and the valid recognition of LGBTQ+ identities, which could perpetuate stigma and misunderstanding, but it does not engage with themes of racial hate.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "promotes racism"}
{"img": "img/27635.png", "response": "Q1a. From the visible text, \"dat ass\" and \"ahmarbkrieh,\" there do not appear to be specifically racist words or typical racial slurs. However, interpretations could vary.\n\nQ1b. \"Dat ass\" is colloquial slang generally used to refer to someone's buttocks in either a sexual or joking manner. \"Ahmarbkrieh\" is not immediately recognizable as a standard term in English, and without context, its meaning is unclear. If the word has a negative connotation in another language or cultural context that targets a racial or ethnic group, that would need cultural and linguistic clarification to establish.\n\nQ2a. The image's components include:\n- The upper half displaying several sheep's rears.\n- A man in the background standing over the sheep.\n- The lower half shows a man wearing sunglasses and a keffiyeh (traditional scarf), shouting into a megaphone with people in the background presumably in a market or a public place.\n\nQ2b. The upper image is a straightforward depiction of sheep, while the lower image captures a man actively shouting or speaking into a megaphone in a busy, possibly urban setting.\n\nQ2c. While the mere depiction of animals and a man yelling does not inherently convey racist meanings, the combination of the images with the text can be interpreted variously based on the context provided by the text. If \"ahmarbkrieh\" is a term that derogates a certain racial or ethnic group, its use here could be seen as racist. Without explicit knowledge of the term's meaning, definitive conclusions are challenging.\n\nQ3. The relation appears to juxtapose the slang expression \"dat ass,\" which usually references human buttocks, with an image of sheep's rears, which might aim for humor. The presence of the term \"ahmarbkrieh\" complicates the interpretation, potentially altering the meme's nature depending on what it translates to or means in a specific cultural context.\n\nQ4. If \"ahmarbkrieh\" has a derogatory or negative connotation associated with a specific racial, ethnic, or cultural group, the meme's hidden message could be promoting a stereotypical or offensive view of that group. The meme's attempt at humor might rely on racial, cultural, or ethnic stereotypes, which can be a form of subtle racism.\n\nQ5. If \"ahmarbkrieh\" is indeed a term that carries a discriminatory or derogatory meaning against a specific group associated with the man wearing the keffiyeh, then the meme could be considered racist. It uses stereotype-based humor targeting a racial, ethnic, or cultural group, which fosters and perpetuates discrimination and prejudice. If, however, the term lacks any racist implications, the meme's content would be poor in taste but not necessarily racist. It would still be important to consider context and the broader implications of using culturally specific motifs in humor, especially when shared across diverse and multi-ethnic platforms.", "label": "1", "predicted_label": "0", "phrase_found": "NA"}
{"img": "img/10749.png", "response": "Q1a. The text does not contain explicitly racist words or phrases per se, but its implication leans towards racism.\n\nQ1b. The text implies a reference to the practice of cotton picking, historically associated with African-American slaves and sharecroppers in the American South. The phrase “my sense of humor is so dark it picks cotton” equates \"darkness\" with a harrowing period of exploitation and racism, punning on the term \"dark\" which is often used colloquially to refer to both severity and African-American identity.\n\nQ2a. The image contains various components and entities like:\n- Multiple individuals, including children, picking cotton in a field.\n- Large cotton plants around the individuals.\n- Clothing typical of late 19th or early 20th century rural settings.\n\nQ2b. The image likely depicts a historical scene of cotton picking, possibly involving African-American individuals, which given historical context, could be suggestive of a time during or shortly after slavery in the United States.\n\nQ2c. The visuals of the cotton field with workers, particularly African-American individuals, are a direct representation of an era marked by slavery and segregation in the U.S. This historical context is racially charged and the usage of such an image in this meme format plays into stereotypical and derogatory representations of black people linked to slavery.\n\nQ3. The image is directly related to the overlaid text as it depicts individuals picking cotton, aligning visually with the text’s mention of “picks cotton”. The text metaphorically compares the speaker's dark humor to the intensive labor of picking cotton, historically a task forced upon African-Americans under oppressive conditions. This relation is employed here to create a shock value aligning dark humor to a grim historical reality.\n\nQ4. The hidden message in this meme seems to trivialize the severe and racially oppressive history of cotton picking in the context of American slavery by equating it to the notion of having an extremely dark sense of humor. This both minimizes the historical suffering involved and inadvertently promotes a flippant viewpoint towards a significant racial issue.\n\nQ5. Yes, this image with its overlaid text should be considered as promoting racial hate. The trivialization and humor derived at the expense of a racially oppressed group's history serve to perpetuate insensitivity towards the issues of race and the legacy of slavery which still affect many people today.

List all explicit or implied meanings for any racist words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\n- The text does not include any explicit or implicit racist messages. The phrase is a play on words that humorously refers to lactose intolerance, a condition where people cannot easily digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products.\n\nQ2a.

List all explicit or implied meanings for any racist visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- There are no explicitly racist visuals in the image. The picture only shows injured or bandaged feet hanging from a building, with no indicators of racial context or stereotypes.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The image is related to the overlaid text through the pun \"lack toes intolerant.\" The image shows feet that are injured or missing toes, which can be linked to being “lack toes” (or “lacking toes”), tying it back to the pun on “lactose intolerant.”\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes racism?\n- There is no evident hidden message in the meme that promotes racism. The meme primarily employs a pun for humorous effect focused on a physical condition (lacking toes), rather than targeting or discriminating against any race or group.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered racism hate? Explain your reasoning.\n- No, this image with its overlaid text should not be considered as promoting racism or hate. The pun \"lack toes intolerant\" does not inherently carry racist undertones, nor does the image of bandaged feet convey hate towards any racial group. The meme seems intended for light humor, relying on wordplay and visual pun rather than perpetuating racism or hate speech.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "promotes racism"}

However, it plays off a controversial political statement and could be seen as racially charged due to context.\n\nQ1b: The phrase “but now Mexicans are the wall. That boy good!!!!\" carries implicit meanings that could be considered racially insensitive or demeaning. The text refers to Mexicans in a metaphorical and reductionist manner, associating them with an inanimate object (a wall), which could suggest dehumanization. Also, referring to a person or individual initiative as \"that boy good\" in this context can be seen as trivializing or patronizing, though it may depend on interpretation.\n\nQ2a: The components and entities in the image include a line of police officers in riot gear lined up across a street, and behind them is a bridge, with people watching from above. \n\nQ2b: In the image, the police officers appear to be forming a barricade or blockade across a street, likely in preparation for or in response to a public gathering or demonstration.\n\nQ2c: There are no expressly racist visuals in the image. The police are shown in a neutral context typical of law enforcement operations. However, juxtaposed with the text, the image of a \"wall\" of police officers might invoke certain metaphorical racist undertones if interpreted in line with the overlaid text.\n\nQ3: The image is related to the overlaid text in that the line of police officers visually represents a \"wall,\" directly tying into the text's pun on Trump’s statement about Mexico paying for a wall and the statement about Mexicans being the wall. The text uses the image of the line of police as a metaphor to make a comment about political and racial issues.\n\nQ4: The hidden message in the meme can be interpreted as making light of or trivializing the serious political and social controversy surrounding immigration and racial attitudes related to Mexicans. It plays on the rhetoric of division and defense against perceived outsiders, potentially promoting a dismissive view towards the complexities and human aspects of immigration issues.\n\nQ5: The image with its overlaid text can be considered racially insensitive or promoting racial stereotypes and should be approached cautiously. While not overtly hateful, its usage of metaphor implicates serious racial topics in a trivializing way, which could potentially contribute to racism by dehumanizing a specific group and belittling their social and political issues.

List all explicit or implied meanings for any racist words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\n- The phrase \"white people on Cinco de Mayo vs. every other day\" implies a point about the behavior or cultural appropriation of white individuals during a holiday significant in Mexican culture, suggesting a stereotype or a generalization about how this group interacts with or represents another culture on specific occasions but not habitually.\n\nQ2a.

How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The image shows a non-Mexican man dressed in traditionally Mexican attire, which relates to the overlaid text mentioning \"white people on Cinco de Mayo,\" suggesting that such attire is worn by white individuals specifically during this holiday, implying a sort of temporary and perhaps superficial engagement with Mexican culture.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes racism?\n- The hidden message may promote stereotypes and cultural appropriation, hinting that it is acceptable or humorous for individuals from one cultural background (white people) to adopt superficial elements of another culture (Mexican) on a particular day without needing a deeper cultural engagement or respect.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered racism hate? Explain your reasoning.\n- While the image and text might not outright promote hate, they do perpetuate stereotypes and engage in cultural appropriation, which can be seen as forms of indirect racism.

However, the conceptual content could be construed as offensive and potentially promoting hate against a religious group.\n\nQ1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any racist words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.  \nThe meme's text implies a violent act (landmines disguised as prayer mats) targeted at those who use prayer mats, commonly associated with the Muslim faith. This could be seen as promoting violence and negative stereotypes against Muslims, thus implying religious intolerance.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.  \nThe image contains a close-up of a dog with a wide-open mouth as if it is in mid-bark or yawn.

The dog does not symbolize or suggest any racial or religious stereotypes.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.  \nThe image of the dog, appearing to shout or exclaim, ties humorously to the shocking nature of the statement in the text. The exaggerated expression can be seen as a visual punctuation to the shocking and controversial \"punchline\" of the joke in the text.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes racism?  \nThe hidden message in this meme is the offensive implication that harming a specific religious group (implied to be Muslims) through violent means (landmines) is humorous. It trivializes the serious nature of violence and religious-targeted hate.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered racism hate? Explain your reasoning.  \nYes, this image with its overlaid text should be considered as promoting hate, specifically religious intolerance or hate against Muslims. The joke about selling landmines disguised as prayer mats trivializes and mocks the religious practice of prayer in Islam, indirectly promoting harm and violence against its practitioners. This falls under promoting hate through ridicule and incitement of violence based on religious grounds.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "negative stereotype"}

This can be seen as promoting insensitivity rather than racism.\n\nQ3: The image is related to the overlaid text in that it tried to make a crude joke about the nature of the bullets supposedly retrieved from a violent hate crime. The juxtaposition of a phallic object with the text mentioning a specific event (Orlando gay nightclub shooting) is meant to play on negative stereotypes and insensitivities toward victims of that incident.\n\nQ4: The hidden message in this meme promotes insensitivity and trivialization of violence against marginalized groups, in this case, the LGBTQ+ community. It uses a significant tragedy as fodder for a joke, which can indirectly encourage a dismissive or accepting stance on violence against marginalized groups.\n\nQ5: Yes, this image with its overlaid text should be considered hate speech towards sexual orientation, not racial. It trivializes a serious and deadly event that targeted a specific community, making a mockery of the trauma and loss suffered. The meme uses the grief of others as a source for crass humor, which is insensitive and inappropriate, contributing to a culture of intolerance and insensitivity towards such violence.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "negative stereotype"}
{"img": "img/49360.png", "response": "A1a. The text \"who wants ice cream\" and \"me me me\" do not contain inherently racist words or phrases.\n\nA1b. There are no explicit or implied racist meanings in the text based on the words alone. These phrases are typically neutral and do not convey racism on their own.\n\nA2a. The image contains two men. One is dressed in a Klu Klux Klan (KKK) robe and hood, which is white and bears the distinctive cone-shaped headpiece and eye holes. The other man is wearing casual clothing and a necklace. There is a wooded or barn setting in the background.\n\nA2b. In the image, the man dressed in the KKK robe is raising his hand, seemingly in response to the overlaid text \"who wants ice cream\". The man in casual clothing is standing beside him but is not the focus.\n\nA2c. The KKK robe is an explicit racist visual. The robe symbolizes the Ku Klux Klan, a historically violent and racist organization in the United States known for promoting white supremacy and committing acts of terrorism and violence against African Americans and other racial groups. The presence of this robe conveys an implicit endorsement or trivialization of the values and violent history associated with the KKK.\n\nA3. The image is related to the overlaid text as the man in the KKK robe appears to be responding to the question \"who wants ice cream\" with an enthusiastic gesture, as if raising his hand in a classroom. The casual phrasing of the text juxtaposed with the serious and hateful symbolism of the KKK robe creates a contrast intended for shock or humor.\n\nA4. The hidden message in this meme that promotes racism lies in the normalization and trivialization of the KKK imagery. By using a light-hearted question about ice cream to provoke a response from a person in a KKK robe, the meme potentially minimizes the violent and racist history associated with the Klan, making it appear benign or humorous when it is not.\n\nA5. Yes, this image with its overlaid text should be considered racism hate. The use of KKK symbolism, a known hate symbol, inherently promotes and perpetuates racism. The attempt to juxtapose this with an innocuous activity like desiring ice cream serves to trivialize the severe implications of such imagery and the historical context of racial hatred it entails. This represents a normalization of hate symbols and could embolden racist sentiments, proving harmful and offensive to those who recognize the robe’s significance.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "promotes racism"}
{"img": "img/87034.png", "response": "Q1a. Does the text contain racist words or phrases?\n- No, the text does not contain racist words or phrases.\n\nQ1b. List all explicit or implied meanings for any racist words or phrases. Explain your reasoning.\n- This question does not apply, as there are no racist words or phrases in the text.\n\nQ2a. List all components and entities in the image.\n- There is a man skydiving.\n- Background: Clear blue sky and landscape (fields and patches of greens) below.\n\nQ2b. What is happening in the image?\n- The image shows a man skydiving; he appears to be free-falling, looking directly at the camera with wide open arms and legs.\n\nQ2c. List all explicit or implied meanings for any racist visuals. Explain your reasoning.\n- There are no racist visuals in the image. It depicts a generic scene of skydiving without any indications of race, ethnicity, or any visuals that could be interpreted as racist.\n\nQ3. How is the image related to the overlaid text? Explain.\n- The text makes a joke related to the act of skydiving, suggesting humorously that 'you don't need a parachute to go skydiving twice'. The image directly illustrates the activity being referred to, that is, skydiving. The implication from the text is that without a parachute, the person could only skydive once because of the fatal outcome from the first time, thus humorously suggesting how essential parachutes are to repeat the activity.\n\nQ4. What’s the hidden message in this meme that promotes racism?\n- There is no hidden message promoting racism in this meme. It is purely a joke about the necessity of a parachute for skydiving. The humor is derived from the absurdity of suggesting going skydiving without a parachute, not from any racial or discriminatory undertones.\n\nQ5. Should this image with its overlaid text be considered racism hate? Explain your reasoning.\n- No, this image with its overlaid text should not be considered racism hate. The content is irrelevant to any notions of race, ethnicity, or cultural backgrounds. It is focused solely on the sport of skydiving and employs humor that does not target or discriminate against any marginalized communities.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "promotes racism"}
{"img": "img/06123.png", "response": "Q1a. The text does not contain explicitly racist words or phrases. It simply reads \"a group of men.\"\n\nQ1b. There are no explicit or implied racist words or phrases within the text itself. It uses a normal phrase that would typically define a collection of male individuals, not indicating any racial context directly.\n\nQ2a. The image includes three dogs, two of which are prominently featured in the foreground, specifically a Bernese Mountain Dog and a Golden Retriever. The background is a simple grassy area.\n\nQ2b. The two dogs in the foreground are looking upwards, seemingly happy, with mouths open as if they are panting or smiling. It appears to be a playful, joyful moment among the dogs.\n\nQ2c. There are no explicit or implied racist visuals in the image. The image of dogs does not inherently carry any racial connotations. It simply portrays dogs in an outdoor, possibly playful setting.\n\nQ3. The image of dogs is humorously related to the overlaid text \"a group of men.\" The joke here attempts to anthropomorphize the dogs, treating them as if they were human men. This is a common humorous technique in memes, which uses the unexpected replacement of people with animals to create a light-hearted, humorous effect.\n\nQ4. There is no hidden message that promotes racism in this meme. The text and image combined seem intended for humor, playing on the unexpected comparison of men to dogs in a non-serious, non-discriminatory way.\n\nQ5. This image with its overlaid text should not be considered racist hate speech. While there could be nuances depending on the context (e.g., if there was particular societal context or inside joke denigrating a specific group by comparing them to dogs), with the given direct content, the meme does not target any racial group, nor does it promote or incite hatred or discrimination toward any group based on race or ethnicity. Instead, it appears simply to aim for a humorous effect by dubbing a group of animals as \"men.\"", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "promotes racism"}
{"img": "img/17028.png", "response": "Q1a: The text does not contain explicitly racist words or phrases by themselves.\n\nQ1b: The phrase “feeling bored, let's go to a mosque” does not contain explicit racist wording, but the context in which a religious site is mentioned in association with boredom can potentially imply an insensitive or disparaging attitude towards the practices or places of significance in Islam. The intent of using a religious site as a remedy for boredom may suggest trivializing or disrespecting religious practices and spaces, potentially fostering a disrespectful or mocking tone towards followers of the religion.\n\nQ2a: The image elements include:\n- Two people, a middle-aged man and a younger woman or teenager, sitting next to each other near a fireplace. \n- The man is holding a glass of wine.\n- The woman is reading a book.\n- Background elements include books, a fireplace, and rustic interior features.\n\nQ2b: A man and a young woman are engaging in a quiet, indoor activity. The man is holding a glass of wine, suggesting a relaxed setting, while the woman is reading a book.\n\nQ2c: There are no explicitly racist visuals in the image based solely on the depicted scene. The image shows a casual, intimate indoor setting without any elements that directly convey racism or utilize racist symbols. However, combined with the text, the image can contribute to the meme’s potentially problematic message.\n\nQ3: The image is related to the overlaid text as it depicts a scene of mundane or ordinary indoor leisure, with the text suggesting that, when bored with such calm activities, going to a mosque is an option. This juxtaposition implies that visiting a mosque is as ordinary or trivial as alleviating boredom, which can be seen as diminishing the importance or sanctity of places of worship in Islam.\n\nQ4: The hidden message in the meme might be promoting a belittling or trivializing view of religious practices or places. By suggesting that one could go to a mosque simply to alleviate boredom, it can be interpreted as reducing a place of religious significance to a mere venue for entertainment or a casual activity, which can subtly perpetuate a lack of respect for or misunderstanding of Islamic practices.\n\nQ5: This image with its overlaid text should be considered potentially promoting racial or religious insensitivity. While not overtly hateful, it trivializes a religious place and practice, which might contribute to a broader culture of disrespect or misunderstanding toward religious groups, in this case, Muslims. This trivialization could foster an environment where religious discrimination or stereotyping is normalized, aligning with subtle forms of racism. Hence, caution should be exercised to avoid such depictions that might inadvertently foster intergroup disrespect or conflict.", "label": "1", "predicted_label": "0", "phrase_found": "not overtly hateful"}
