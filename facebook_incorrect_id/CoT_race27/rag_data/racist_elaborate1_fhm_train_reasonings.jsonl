This use of satire to address a grave matter can be seen as minimizing the severity of the issue and promoting divisive and hurtful sentiments.

Making light of such a serious and painful subject by using a wordplay that references a symbol of the victims of genocide is seen as minimizing the atrocities and the suffering experienced by the Jewish people during this time.

This creates a false and offensive comparison, implying that the suffering of human victims was lesser or acceptable, which is deeply dehumanizing and disrespectful to those who suffered.\n\n3. **Trivialization of Suffering**: The format of a meme, generally light-hearted or humorous, is an inappropriate medium to handle sensitive topics related to mass suffering and genocide.

Additionally, using a pun on the name of Anne Frank, a well-known victim of the Holocaust whose diary gave a personal and heartbreaking view of the horrors faced by Jews during World War II, is particularly insensitive.
