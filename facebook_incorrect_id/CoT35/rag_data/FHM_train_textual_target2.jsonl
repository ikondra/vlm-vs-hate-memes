{"img": "img/58426.png", "prompt": "Who or what is the target of the text?", "response": "The text in the image appears to be dark humor targeting the concept of improvisation in unexpected or lacking situations.

This phrase is famously associated with Bear Grylls, who often uses it on his adventure shows, though the context provided here is quite inappropriate.", "version": "query"}
