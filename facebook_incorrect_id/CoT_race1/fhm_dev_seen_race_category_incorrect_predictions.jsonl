However, the text could be seen as perpetuating a narrative that may lead to biases or stereotypes against a whole group based on the actions of a few, which can contribute to a broader context that enables racism. It is important to note that xenophobia and racism are related but distinct concepts; xenophobia is generally directed at individuals from other countries or cultures, regardless of race, while racism is specifically about prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against individuals based on their race.
