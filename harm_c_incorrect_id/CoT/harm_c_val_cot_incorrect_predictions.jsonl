Such a message can be perceived as perpetuating hostility towards China or people of Chinese origin by using the stereotype in a detrimental manner, particularly in the context of a global health crisis that has already seen instances of prejudice and racism. Therefore, one could argue that the image, by means of the text, may foster or reinforce harmful biases and thus could reasonably be classified as containing hate within the specified context.

If the answer to Part A was \"yes\": Ignoring the image, what does the overlaid text say?\nThe text reads: \"China virus: can be contracted only through human contact Introverts:\"\n\nQ1c. If the answer to Part A \"yes\": Are there any derogatory, humiliating, insulting, or disparaging words or phrases used?\nThe term \"China virus\" can be viewed as derogatory or stigmatizing because it associates the virus with a specific country in a way that could promote xenophobia or racism towards individuals of Chinese or Asian descent. The rest of the text references \"Introverts\" but does not seem to contain derogatory, humiliating, insulting, or disparaging language directed at them.\n\nQ2a. Ignoring the overlaid text, what does the image depict?\nThe image depicts a man smiling or smirking behind what appears to be a metal barrier or set of bars.\n\nQ2b.

Taking into account the previous answers, could the text be describing something about the image that makes it hateful in this context?\nThe term \"China virus\" in the text could contribute to a negative portrayal or sentiment towards individuals of Chinese or Asian descent, especially when paired with the image which might be understood to mock or trivialize the situation. Context is crucial, and while the rest of the text seems to play on a stereotype about introverts preferring to avoid social contact, thereby being less at risk during a pandemic, the pairing of the text with the image can potentially be interpreted in a way that is insensitive.\n\nQ4. Based on the definition of “hate” as hatred, hostility, or violence towards member(s) of a race, ethnicity, nation, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or any other designated sector of society, should this image be classified as hateful? Explain your reasoning.\nAlthough the image of the man alone is not hateful, the inclusion of the term \"China virus\" in the text is problematic because it can perpetuate xenophobic attitudes, potentially leading to hostility towards individuals of Chinese or Asian ethnicity. Such language has been associated with an uptick in racist incidents against Asians since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it could be argued that this image, because of the text, could be classified as potentially hateful towards members of a specific nationality or ethnic group. However, the ultimate classification could depend on the context in which the image is being used or presented.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "potentially hateful"}
{"img": "images/covid_memes_235.png", "response": "Q1a. Yes, there is text present in the image.\n\nQ1b. The text says \"The Corona Virus won't last long because it was made in China.\"\n\nQ1c. The text uses a stereotype about products made in China being of poor quality to imply that the coronavirus will not last long for the same reason. While not using overtly derogatory or offensive language, this statement can be interpreted as perpetuating a nationalistic stereotype and could be seen as disparaging or insulting towards Chinese manufacturing or, more broadly, China as a nation.\n\nQ2a. The image depicts a character (Lisa Simpson from the animated television series \"The Simpsons\") presenting the written text on a presentation board or screen.\n\nQ2b. There are no inherently derogatory, humiliating, insulting, or disparaging components of the image if we consider only the illustration of the cartoon character. However, when taking into account the full context with the overlaid text, it could be perceived as disparaging toward Chinese manufacturing or the nation of China.\n\nQ2c. There is no direct symbolism or imagery used by known hateful groups in the image.\n\nQ2d. The image itself does not use symbolism or imagery as a stand-in or reference to any marginalized groups or other designated sectors of society. However, it is the text that makes an implied reference to China.\n\nQ3. The text can be interpreted as a joke that relies on a national stereotype about the quality of products made in China. In this context, the text could be understood as making a sarcastic comment that could be viewed as perpetuating a stereotype, which some might find disrespectful or offensive.\n\nQ4.

While the text does not explicitly incite hatred, hostility, or violence towards Chinese individuals or China as a nation, it does rely on a stereotype that might be considered disrespectful or offensive by some. This stereotype could contribute to a broader environment of disrespect towards people of Chinese descent or nationality. Therefore, some might argue that it indirectly promotes a form of nationalistic disparagement, which could contribute to an atmosphere of intolerance or prejudice.", "label": "0", "predicted_label": "1", "phrase_found": "should be classified as hate"}
