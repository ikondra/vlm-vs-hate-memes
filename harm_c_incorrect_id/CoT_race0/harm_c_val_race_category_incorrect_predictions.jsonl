If such language is present, it would be directed at specific groups or individuals.\n\nQ2a. You would describe the subjects, settings, or actions depicted in the image without the overlaid text.\n\nQ2b. Hateful or offensive components should be identified based on visual symbols, expressions, or any depictions that might imply racism.\n\nQ2c.
